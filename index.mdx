## What is Ankra?

Ankra is a platform for managing Kubernetes clusters at scale. Import any cluster, deploy add-ons, automate operations, and get deep visibility into your infrastructure, all from a single interface.

Built for teams, Ankra makes it simple to collaborate, standardize environments, and keep clusters secure, whether you're running in the cloud or on-premises.

## The Problem

You know the drill. Something's broken in production:

- **5 terminal tabs open** - one for logs, one for events, one for describe, one for the other pod, one you forgot about
- **Copy-pasting YAML** between clusters because "it worked in staging"
- **Helm values files** scattered across repos, Slack threads, and that one wiki page nobody updates
- **Hours debugging** only to find it was a typo in a ConfigMap

Kubernetes is powerful. But the developer experience? It's death by a thousand `kubectl` commands.

---

## What Ankra Does

Ankra gives you a single place to manage, debug, and deploy to your Kubernetes clusters.

### Debug in seconds, not hours

When something breaks, ask the AI: *"Why is my pod crashing?"*

It already has the logs, events, manifests, and metrics. It finds the OOMKilled event, correlates it with the memory spike, identifies the missing resource limit, and tells you how to fix it.

No more `kubectl logs | grep error | head -50` → `kubectl describe pod` → `kubectl get events` → repeat.

### Deploy stacks, not YAML files

Need Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki? Describe it to the AI or use the visual Stack Builder. Dependencies are handled. Values are configured. Deploy with one click.

Clone that stack to staging with `ankra clone`. Done.

### GitOps without the setup

Connect your GitHub repo. Your stacks sync automatically. No ArgoCD installation. No Flux configuration. No CRDs to manage.

Push to main, your cluster updates.
