## What is Ankra?

Ankra is a platform that brings together everything you need to manage Kubernetes at scale. You can import any cluster, deploy and manage add-ons, automate operations, and get deep visibility into your infrastructure, all from a single, easy-to-use interface.

Ankra is built for teams, making it simple to collaborate, standardize environments, and keep your clusters secure and up to date, whether you’re running in the cloud or on-premises.
