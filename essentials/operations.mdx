# Operations & Jobs

<Note>
Operations and jobs in Ankra give you full visibility into every automation task running in your infrastructure—so you always know what’s happening, when, and why.
</Note>

## What Are Operations and Jobs?

- **Operations** are high-level automation tasks triggered by you or the platform, such as creating a cluster, upgrading add-ons, or rolling out a stack.
- **Jobs** are the individual steps or actions that make up an operation. For example, provisioning a managed cluster in AWS may involve over 130 jobs, each handling a specific part of the process (network setup, node creation, add-on installation, etc.).

## How Operations & Jobs Work in Ankra

When you trigger an automation—such as creating a cluster, installing an add-on, or updating a stack—Ankra creates an **operation**. This operation is then broken down into a series of **jobs**, each representing a specific step in the process.

For example, creating a managed cluster in AWS might include jobs for:

- Setting up VPC and networking
- Configuring IAM roles and permissions
- Provisioning node groups and instances
- Installing add-ons and stacks
- Running health checks and validations
- Finalizing and reporting status

Each job runs independently, and you can monitor their progress in real time. If a job fails, you’ll see detailed logs and error messages to help you quickly resolve the issue.
