description: Track, manage, and troubleshoot automation tasks and jobs in Ankra.

<Note>
Operations and jobs in Ankra let you see exactly what’s happening in your infrastructure, so you always know what’s running, when, and why.
</Note>


## What Are Operations and Jobs?

**Operations** are the main automation tasks you or the platform start, like deploying a stack, upgrading add-ons, or syncing GitOps configuration.
**Jobs** are the smaller steps that make up each operation. For example, when you deploy a stack with multiple add-ons, each chart installation is a separate job, along with jobs for dependency resolution, values processing, and health checks.

## How Operations & Jobs Work in Ankra


When you start an automation, like deploying a stack, installing an add-on, or syncing GitOps configuration, Ankra creates an operation. That operation is then split into a series of jobs, each one handling a specific step.

For example, deploying a stack with multiple add-ons might include jobs for:

- Resolving chart dependencies
- Processing values files
- Installing or upgrading Helm releases
- Applying raw manifests
- Running health checks and validations
- Syncing status to GitOps repository

Each job runs on its own, and you can watch their progress in real time. If something fails, you'll see logs and error messages to help you fix it quickly.

## How to Use Operations & Jobs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger an Operation">
    Start an automation task in Ankra, like creating a cluster, installing an add-on, or updating a stack.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    Watch the operation in the Ankra dashboard. Visual indicators show which jobs are running, done, or failed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Inspect Jobs and Logs">
    Click any operation to see all its jobs. Check logs, error messages, and details for each job.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Troubleshoot and Retry">
    If a job fails, review the logs and error details. Retry failed jobs or restart the operation if needed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Operation History">
    See a complete history of all operations and jobs for audits, compliance, and troubleshooting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-World Example


**Deploying a Full-Stack Application:**
When you deploy a stack with monitoring, database, and application components, you might see jobs like:

- Installing cert-manager for TLS certificates
- Setting up prometheus-operator for monitoring
- Deploying PostgreSQL database with custom values
- Installing your application Helm chart
- Applying Kubernetes manifests for ingress rules
- Running readiness and health checks

You can follow each step in the UI, check logs for every job, and get notified right away if something goes wrong.
