<Note>
Operations and jobs in Ankra let you see exactly what’s happening in your infrastructure, so you always know what’s running, when, and why.
</Note>


## What Are Operations and Jobs?

**Operations** are the main automation tasks you or the platform start, like creating a cluster, upgrading add-ons, or rolling out a stack.
**Jobs** are the smaller steps that make up each operation. For example, when you create a managed cluster in AWS, there might be over 130 jobs, each handling a specific part of the process, like setting up networking, creating nodes, or installing add-ons.

## How Operations & Jobs Work in Ankra


When you start an automation, like creating a cluster, installing an add-on, or updating a stack, Ankra creates an operation. That operation is then split into a series of jobs, each one handling a specific step.

For example, creating a managed cluster in AWS might include jobs for:

- Setting up VPC and networking
- Configuring IAM roles and permissions
- Provisioning node groups and instances
- Installing add-ons and stacks
- Running health checks and validations
- Finalizing and reporting status

Each job runs on its own, and you can watch their progress in real time. If something fails, you’ll see logs and error messages to help you fix it quickly.

## Real-World Example


**Managed Cluster Creation in AWS:**
When you create a managed cluster, there can be over 130 jobs, like:

- Creating VPCs and subnets
- Setting up security groups and IAM roles
- Launching EC2 instances for nodes
- Installing monitoring, logging, and ingress add-ons
- Running post-install health checks

You can follow each step in the UI, check logs for every job, and get notified right away if something goes wrong.
