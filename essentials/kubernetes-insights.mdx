description: Unified visibility and control for all your Kubernetes clusters in Ankra
---
Ankra gives you a single, easy-to-use UI for managing and observing all your Kubernetes clusters, no matter where they run. Once you add a cluster to Ankra, you get deep visibility and control, fully integrated with your infrastructure management workflows.

## Explore All Your Kubernetes Resources

- **Unified Resource Browser:** Instantly navigate through all Kubernetes resources like Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and more, across every connected cluster.
- **Multi-Cluster View:** Switch between clusters and get a consistent, real-time view of your entire Kubernetes landscape from one dashboard.
- **Namespace Filtering:** Focus on specific namespaces or resources to quickly find what you need.

## Deep Resource Insights

- **Live Configuration:** See the live YAML or JSON configuration of any resource. Check environment variables, labels, annotations, resource limits, and more.
- **Pod Logs:** View real-time and historical logs for any pod right in the UI, making troubleshooting quick and easy.
- **Events & Status:** See recent events, health status, and error messages for any resource to quickly spot issues.

## Take Action Directly

- **Resource Actions:** Delete pods, restart deployments, or scale resources directly from the UI. No kubectl needed.
- **Safe & Auditable:** All actions respect permissions and are logged for auditability, so your team can operate safely.

## Unified Insights & Troubleshooting

- **Centralized Monitoring:** Monitor all your clusters in one place, so you don’t have to juggle multiple dashboards or kubectl contexts.
- **Search & Filter:** Quickly find resources by name, label, or status, even across clusters.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Drill down from cluster to namespace to pod to log, so you can troubleshoot and resolve issues faster.

## Why Use Ankra for Kubernetes Observability?

- **Consistent Experience:** Use a familiar, intuitive interface that’s fully integrated with Ankra’s infrastructure management.
- **Team Collaboration:** Share insights, resource views, and troubleshooting context with your team, all in one place.
- **Full Control:** Keep visibility and control even as your infrastructure grows to multiple clusters and environments.

> **Tip:** Use Ankra’s advanced filtering and search to instantly find any resource or event, no matter how many clusters you manage.
