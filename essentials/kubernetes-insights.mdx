# Kubernetes Insights

Ankra provides a powerful, unified UI for managing and observing all your Kubernetes clusters—no matter where they run. Once you add a cluster to Ankra, you gain deep visibility and control with fully integrated with your infrastructure management workflows.

## Explore All Your Kubernetes Resources

- **Unified Resource Browser:** Instantly navigate through all Kubernetes resources—Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and more—across every connected cluster.
- **Multi-Cluster View:** Effortlessly switch between clusters and get a consistent, real-time view of your entire Kubernetes landscape from a single dashboard.
- **Namespace Filtering:** Focus on specific namespaces or resources to quickly find what you need.

## Deep Resource Insights

- **Live Configuration:** Inspect the live YAML/JSON configuration of any resource. See environment variables, labels, annotations, resource limits, and more.
- **Pod Logs:** Access real-time and historical logs for any pod directly in the UI, making troubleshooting fast and intuitive.
- **Events & Status:** View recent events, health status, and error messages for any resource to quickly identify issues.

## Take Action Directly

- **Resource Actions:** Perform actions such as deleting pods, restarting deployments, or scaling resources directly from the UI—no kubectl required.
- **Safe & Auditable:** All actions are permission-aware and logged for auditability, ensuring safe operations across your teams.

## Unified Insights & Troubleshooting

- **Centralized Monitoring:** Get a single pane of glass for all your clusters, eliminating the need to juggle multiple dashboards or kubectl contexts.
- **Search & Filter:** Quickly locate resources by name, label, or status—even across clusters.
- **Root Cause Analysis:** Drill down from cluster to namespace to pod to log, accelerating troubleshooting and resolution.

## Why Use Ankra for Kubernetes Observability?

- **Consistent Experience:** Enjoy a familiar, intuitive interface inspired by industry leaders with fully integrated with Ankra’s infrastructure management.
- **Team Collaboration:** Share insights, resource views, and troubleshooting context with your team, all in one place.
- **Full Control:** Maintain visibility and control even as your infrastructure scales to multiple clusters and environments.
