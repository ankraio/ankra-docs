# GitOps: Modern Kubernetes Cluster Management with Ankra

Welcome to the next-generation GitOps approach for managing Kubernetes clusters with Ankra. This guide walks you through setting up a scalable repository structure, integrating with Ankra's WebUI, and leveraging AI-powered configuration tools.

<Note>
A well-structured GitOps repository unlocks automation, reproducibility, and seamless collaboration for your platform engineering and DevOps teams.
</Note>

## Repository Structure: The Foundation

Organize your repository around a `clusters/` directory. Each cluster gets its own folder, named to match its Ankra identity (e.g., `prod-cluster-6chysytvjq/`). Inside each cluster folder, you'll find:

## How Ankra Integrates With Your Repo

Ankra reads your cluster definition YAML (`apiVersion: v1`, `kind: ImportCluster`) and syncs with your Git repository. The platform automatically detects stacks, dependencies, and configuration files, then visualizes and manages them in the WebUI.

- **Stack-Based Architecture:** Stacks group related services and control deployment order. Dependencies are resolved automatically.
- **Git Integration:** Specify provider, credentials, branch, and repo in your YAML. Ankra keeps your clusters in sync with Git.
- **WebUI Experience:** Use Stack Builder to visually manage stacks, dependencies, and resources. Drag, drop, and edit with instant feedback.

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Workflow: From Repo to Running Clusters

1. **Create your GitHub repository and connect it to Ankra.**
2. **Add your clusters:** Create folders, add manifests, add-ons, and cluster definition YAMLs.
3. **Configure stacks and dependencies visually in Stack Builder.**
4. **Leverage the AI editor for validation and optimization.**
5. **Preview, validate, and deploy—all from the WebUI.**
6. **Monitor deployments and cluster state in real time.**

<Divider />

## Impact: What Happens When You Commit

- Ankra reads your changes, deploys stacks in the correct order, and maintains your cluster's desired state.
- Multi-cluster support lets you manage dev, staging, and prod from a single repo.
- Rollbacks, drift detection, and cross-cluster dependencies are handled automatically.

## Best Practices

<Callout type="tip">
Use clear, consistent naming for clusters, stacks, and services. Organize Helm values for easy overrides. Integrate Infisical for secrets. Separate infrastructure and application stacks for maintainability.
</Callout>

<Divider />

## Troubleshooting

<Callout type="warning">
If you run into issues, check your directory structure, file naming, and Git credentials. Use Stack Builder and the AI editor to resolve configuration errors and validate dependencies.

## Example: Modern Cluster Repo

```plaintext
clusters/
  prod-cluster-6chysytvjq/
    add-ons/
    manifests/
    argocd/
    prod-cluster.yaml
  dev-cluster-134pmgb2lw/
    add-ons/
    manifests/
    argocd/
    dev-cluster.yaml
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImportCluster
metadata:
  name: prod-cluster-6chysytvjq
spec:
  git_repository:
    provider: github
    credential_name: User-CodeStaple
    branch: main
    repository: CodeStaple/cluster-repo
  stacks:
    # Define stacks and dependencies here
```

> **Pro Tip:** This approach streamlines the entire software lifecycle, from development to production. It makes it easy to reproduce, update, and manage clusters at every stage.

## YAML Breakdown: Cluster Definition

| Key/Path | Description |
|---|---|
| `apiVersion: v1` | Specifies the API version for the resource. |
| `kind: ImportCluster` | Declares the type of resource to create (an imported cluster). |
| `metadata.name` | The name of your cluster (matches directory name). |
| `spec.git_repository.provider` | The Git provider (e.g., github, gitlab). |
| `spec.git_repository.credential_name` | The credential to use for accessing the repo. |
| `spec.git_repository.branch` | The branch to watch for changes. |
| `spec.git_repository.repository` | The repository path (org/repo). |
| `spec.stacks` | List of stacks to deploy to the cluster. |
| `stacks[].name` | Name of the stack. |
| `stacks[].description` | Description of the stack. |
| `stacks[].manifests` | List of manifests to apply. |
| `manifests[].name` | Name of the manifest. |
| `manifests[].manifest_base64` | The manifest YAML, base64-encoded. |
| `manifests[].namespace` | Namespace for the manifest. |
| `manifests[].parents` | Dependencies for this manifest. |
| `stacks[].addons` | List of add-ons to install. |
| `addons[].name` | Name of the add-on. |
| `addons[].chart_name` | Helm chart name for the add-on. |
| `addons[].chart_version` | Version of the Helm chart. |
| `addons[].repository_url` | URL of the Helm chart repository. |
| `addons[].namespace` | Namespace for the add-on. |
| `addons[].configuration_type` | How the add-on is configured (e.g., standalone). |
| `addons[].configuration.values_base64` | Helm values.yaml, base64-encoded. |
| `addons[].parents` | Dependencies for this add-on. |

## Understanding the ArgoCD Folder

Each cluster directory contains an `argocd/` folder. This folder is used by ArgoCD for managing application deployments and syncing resources. **Important:** The files in the `argocd/` folder are auto-generated by Ankra and will be overwritten on each sync or update. Any manual changes made here will not persist.

The true source of your cluster configuration is always the `add-ons/` folder and your cluster definition YAML. To make lasting changes, update your manifests and Helm values in the `add-ons/` folder or your cluster YAML—never directly in `argocd/`.

<Callout type="warning">
Do not manually edit files in the `argocd/` folder. All changes should be made in your cluster's `add-ons/` folder and cluster definition YAML. The `argocd/` folder will be regenerated automatically.
</Callout>

## Writing a Cluster YAML: Referencing Manifests and Helm Values

Ankra supports referencing external files in your cluster YAML using the `from_file` key. This makes your configuration modular, readable, and easy to maintain.

### Example Structure

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImportCluster
metadata:
  name: prod-cluster
  description: Your imported cluster
spec:
  git_repository:
    provider: github
    credential_name: User-CodeStaple
    branch: main
    repository: CodeStaple/addons2
  stacks:
    - name: infisical
      description: 'Secret management for the stack.'
      manifests:
        - name: infisical ns
          from_file: manifests/infisical ns.yaml
        - name: infisical secret
          parents:
            - name: infisical ns
              kind: manifest
          from_file: manifests/infisical secret.yaml
      addons:
        - name: infisical
          chart_name: infisical
          chart_version: 0.4.2
          repository_url: https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/helm-charts/helm/charts
          namespace: infisical
          configuration_type: standalone
          configuration:
            from_file: add-ons/infisical/values.yaml
```

### How `from_file` Works

**Manifests:**
- Use `from_file` to reference Kubernetes YAML files (e.g., CRDs, RBAC, ConfigMaps) stored in your repo. This keeps your cluster definition clean and lets you reuse files across stacks.

**Add-ons (Helm):**
- Use `from_file` under `configuration` to point to a Helm values.yaml file. This allows you to customize Helm charts without embedding large YAML blocks directly in your cluster definition.

#### Example: ingress-nginx values.yaml

```yaml
controller:
  ingressClassResource:
    enabled: true
  service:
    type: NodePort
    nodePorts:
      http: "30080"
      https: "30443"
```

Referenced in your cluster YAML as:

```yaml
addons:
  - name: ingress-nginx
    chart_name: ingress-nginx
    chart_version: 4.12.3
    repository_url: https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
    namespace: ingress-nginx
    configuration_type: standalone
    configuration:
      from_file: add-ons/ingress-nginx/values.yaml
```

#### Example: Manifest File

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: local-path-provisioner-role
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["nodes", "persistentvolumeclaims", "configmaps", "pods", "pods/log"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["persistentvolumes"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch", "create", "patch", "update", "delete"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["events"]
    verbs: ["create", "patch"]
  - apiGroups: ["storage.k8s.io"]
    resources: ["storageclasses"]
    verbs: ["get", "list", "watch"]
```

Referenced in your cluster YAML as:

```yaml
manifests:
  - name: local-path-provisioner-role
    from_file: manifests/clusterRole: local-path-storage.yaml
```

<Callout type="tip">
Use `from_file` to keep your cluster YAML concise and maintainable. Store all manifests and values files in organized folders (e.g., `manifests/`, `add-ons/`).
