## What is an Add-on?

An add-on is a packaged application or tool that extends the functionality of your Kubernetes cluster. Add-ons are typically distributed as Helm charts and can include anything from monitoring tools and ingress controllers to security solutions and custom integrations. An add-on could even be your own application, integrated into the Ankra ecosystem for easy deployment and management. By using add-ons, you can quickly enhance your clusters with new features and automate the deployment of common services.

## üóÇÔ∏è Manage Add-on Sources

An add-on source in Ankra is either a Helm repository URL or an OCI (Open Container Initiative) registry URL. These sources contain the Helm charts you want to use for deploying add-ons to your clusters. Helm charts are a standard way to package Kubernetes applications, making it easy to manage dependencies and versioning for complex workloads.

By connecting both public and private Helm repositories or OCI registries, you can access a wide range of Kubernetes add-ons. This lets you integrate open-source tools, vendor solutions, or your own custom charts‚Äîall from a single interface. Managing sources centrally ensures your team always has access to the latest and most secure versions of your preferred add-ons.

**How to Add a Source:**

1. Go to the <b>Add-ons</b> section in the Ankra platform.
2. Click <b>Manage Sources</b>.
3. Click <b>Add</b> and enter the Helm repository or OCI registry URL you want to use.

Once you add a source, Ankra will begin indexing the available charts. You‚Äôll see a <b>Last Synced</b> timestamp update when indexing is complete. After that, your add-ons will be available for installation.

## üß© Stacks

To deploy an add-on onto your cluster, add it to a stack. You can add multiple add-ons and manifests to build a <b>Stack</b>, which is a repeatable, reusable set of components for your Kubernetes environments.
Stacks let you bundle everything your application or platform needs, from monitoring and logging to ingress controllers and security policies. You can version stacks, share them with your team, and deploy them to any cluster with a single action. This approach speeds up onboarding, reduces errors, and helps make sure every environment is production-ready.

## ‚ûï Install Add-ons

Select an add-on from your available sources and install it directly onto one or many clusters with just a few clicks.
The installation process is simple. You don‚Äôt need to manually configure Helm or write complex scripts. Ankra handles versioning, dependency management, and cluster targeting for you. This makes it easy to standardize tooling and services across all your environments, ensuring consistency and reducing operational overhead.

## üìÑ Manifests

A <b>manifest</b> is a Kubernetes YAML file that defines resources or configuration, like namespaces, CRDs, or RBAC rules.
In Ankra, manifests help you:

- **Include manifests in stacks:** Make sure your clusters are ready for add-ons by setting up all prerequisites and custom resources first.
- **Automate environment setup:** Create the foundational resources your add-ons and workloads need, so your stacks are fully self-contained and repeatable.

Manifests are key for customizing clusters and making sure every deployment fits your team's needs.

With add-ons, manifests, and stacks, Ankra makes it easy to manage, scale, and standardize your Kubernetes infrastructure, no matter how complex your needs are.
