# Add-ons

<Note>
Easily extend your clusters with powerful integrations, tools, and automation using Ankra Add-ons.
</Note>

## 🗂️ Manage Add-on Sources

Click <b>Manage Source</b> to add additional Helm repositories.
You can connect both public and private Helm repositories, giving you access to a wide range of Kubernetes add-ons. This flexibility allows you to integrate open-source tools, vendor-provided solutions, or your own custom charts, all from a single interface. Managing sources centrally ensures your team always has access to the latest and most secure versions of your preferred add-ons.

---

## ➕ Install Add-ons

Select an add-on from your available sources and install it directly onto one or many clusters with just a few clicks.
The installation process is streamlined—no need to manually configure Helm or write complex scripts. Ankra handles versioning, dependency management, and cluster targeting for you. This makes it easy to standardize tooling and services across all your environments, ensuring consistency and reducing operational overhead.

---

## 🗃️ Profiles

Once you have an add-on configured to your needs, save it as a <b>Profile</b>.
Profiles capture your configuration—including values, secrets, and overrides—so you can:

- **Reuse the same setup across clusters:** Apply a profile to any cluster to instantly replicate your preferred configuration.
- **Update multiple clusters at once:** Modify a profile and roll out changes to all clusters using it, ensuring consistency and saving time.

Profiles are ideal for organizations managing multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) or teams that want to enforce best practices.

## 🧩 Stacks

Combine multiple add-ons and manifests to build a <b>Stack</b>—a repeatable, reusable set of components for your Kubernetes environments.
Stacks let you bundle everything your application or platform needs, from monitoring and logging to ingress controllers and security policies. You can version stacks, share them with your team, and deploy them to any cluster with a single action. This approach accelerates onboarding, reduces errors, and ensures every environment is production-ready.

## 📄 Manifests

A <b>manifest</b> is a Kubernetes YAML file that defines resources or configuration, such as namespaces, CRDs, or RBAC rules.
In Ankra, you can:

- **Include manifests in stacks:** Prepare your clusters for add-ons by ensuring all prerequisites and custom resources are set up before installation.
- **Automate environment setup:** Use manifests to create the foundational resources your add-ons and workloads depend on, making your stacks fully self-contained and repeatable.

Manifests are essential for customizing clusters and ensuring that every deployment meets your organization’s requirements.

With add-ons, profiles, stacks, and manifests, Ankra makes it easy to manage, scale, and standardize your Kubernetes infrastructure—no matter how complex your needs.
