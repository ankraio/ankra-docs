<Note>
Organisations in Ankra help you manage access, resources, and collaboration for your team. You can invite users, assign roles, and switch between organisations to keep your workspaces organized.
</Note>

## Accessing Organisations

1. Click your profile icon in the menu at the bottom left of the Ankra platform.
2. Select **Organisation**.
3. You’ll see a list of all organisations you belong to, including the ones you own and those you’ve joined.

## Switching Organisations

- Each organisation in the list has a menu button. Click it to switch to that organisation.
- When you switch, your active session updates to reference that organisation. You’ll see only the stacks, clusters, and credentials for the selected organisation.

## Inviting Users

- To add people, click **Add User** in the organisation view.
- Enter the user’s email address to send an invitation.
- You can assign one of two roles:
  - **Admin:** Can invite and remove users, and manage all organisation settings.
  - **Member:** Can use the platform but cannot invite others.

## Managing Users & Roles

- **Admins** can invite new users, remove any user, and manage organisation settings.
- **Members** can remove themselves from the organisation but cannot remove others or invite new users.
- To remove a user, use the menu next to their name in the user list.

## Best Practices

- Use organisations to separate projects, teams, or environments.
- Assign admin rights only to trusted team members.
- Regularly review your organisation’s user list to keep access up to date.

> **Tip:** Switching organisations changes your view to only the resources, stacks, and credentials for that organisation. This helps keep your work organized and secure.
