## Accessing Organisations

Find and manage all the organisations you belong to in Ankra.

1. Click your profile icon in the menu at the bottom left of the Ankra platform.
2. Select **Organisation**.
3. You’ll see a list of all organisations you belong to, including the ones you own and those you’ve joined.

## Switching Organisations

Switch between organisations to see the resources, stacks, and credentials for each one.

- Each organisation in the list has a menu button. Click it to switch to that organisation.
- When you switch, your active session updates to reference that organisation. You’ll see only the stacks, clusters, and credentials for the selected organisation.

## Inviting Users

Invite teammates to your organisation by email and assign their role.

- To add people, click **Add User** in the organisation view.
- Enter the user’s email address to send an invitation.
- You can assign one of two roles:
  - **Admin:** Can invite and remove users, and manage all organisation settings.
  - **Member:** Can use the platform but cannot invite others.

## Managing Users & Roles

Control who has access to your organisation and what they can do.

- **Admins** can invite new users, remove any user, and manage organisation settings.
- **Members** can remove themselves from the organisation but cannot remove others or invite new users.
- To remove a user, use the menu next to their name in the user list.

## Best Practices

Tips for keeping your organisations secure and well managed.

- Use organisations to separate projects, teams, or environments.
- Assign admin rights only to trusted team members.
- Regularly review your organisation’s user list to keep access up to date.

> **Tip:** Switching organisations changes your view to only the resources, stacks, and credentials for that organisation. This helps keep your work organized and secure.
