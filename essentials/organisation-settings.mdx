<Note>
Organisation settings apply to all clusters and resources within your organisation. Only administrators can modify these settings.
</Note>

## Accessing Organisation Settings

1. Click your profile icon in the bottom left corner of the Ankra platform.
2. Select **Organisation** from the menu.
3. Click **Settings** in the organisation view.
4. Navigate to **General** to access these settings.

## General Settings

### Organisation Name

Change the display name of your organisation. This name appears throughout the platform and helps identify your workspace.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Organisation Settings** → **General**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Edit the Name">
    Enter a new name in the **Organisation Name** field.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Changes">
    Click **Save Changes** to apply.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Only administrators can rename organisations. Members will see the rename option disabled.
</Info>

## Agent Settings

Configure default agent behavior for all clusters in your organisation.

### Auto-upgrade Agents

When enabled, cluster agents automatically upgrade to the latest version when available. This ensures your clusters stay up-to-date with security patches and new features.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Enabled** | Agents upgrade automatically when new versions are released |
| **Disabled** | Agents remain at their current version until manually upgraded |

<Tip>
Individual clusters can opt-out of auto-upgrades in their own settings, even when the organisation setting is enabled. See [Cluster Settings](/essentials/cluster-settings) for details.
</Tip>

**How Auto-upgrade Works:**

1. Ankra releases a new agent version
2. The platform detects clusters running older versions
3. If auto-upgrade is enabled (and the cluster hasn't opted out), the agent is upgraded automatically
4. The upgrade process is seamless with minimal disruption

## AI Features

Configure AI-powered capabilities for your organisation.

### Proactive AI Insights

When enabled, Ankra's AI automatically analyzes cluster health issues and provides:

- **Root Cause Analysis**: Identifies the underlying cause of detected problems
- **Recommended Actions**: Suggests steps to resolve issues
- **Conversation Starters**: Provides prompts to discuss issues with the AI Assistant

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to AI Features">
    Go to **Organisation Settings** → **General** and find the **AI Features** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Proactive AI Insights">
    Enable or disable the **Proactive AI Insights** toggle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
When disabled, AI analysis still works on-demand via the AI Assistant (`⌘+J`), but automatic proactive insights are not generated.
</Info>

**Use Cases for Proactive AI Insights:**

| Scenario | AI Insight |
|----------|------------|
| Pod crash loop | Identifies common causes like OOM, missing configs, or image issues |
| High resource usage | Suggests scaling recommendations |
| Failed deployments | Analyzes sync errors and provides remediation steps |
| Network issues | Identifies service mesh or ingress misconfigurations |

## Danger Zone

<Warning>
Actions in the Danger Zone are destructive and cannot be undone. Proceed with extreme caution.
</Warning>

### Delete Organisation

Permanently remove your organisation and all associated data, including:

- All clusters (disconnected, not deleted from your infrastructure)
- All stacks and configurations
- All credentials and integrations
- All user memberships

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Danger Zone">
    Go to **Organisation Settings** → **General** and scroll to the **Danger Zone** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Delete">
    Click the **Delete** button. Only administrators see this option.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Deletion">
    Type the organisation name exactly as shown to confirm, then click **Delete Organisation**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Deleting an organisation does not delete resources from your Kubernetes clusters. It only removes them from the Ankra platform. Running workloads will continue to run.
</Warning>
