# Stacks

<Note>
Stacks let you bundle add-ons, profiles, and manifests into a reusable, versioned package—making it easy to deploy consistent Kubernetes environments at scale.
</Note>

## What is a Stack?

A **Stack** in Ankra is a collection of add-ons, profiles, and manifests grouped together to define a complete Kubernetes environment. Stacks are reusable and can be versioned, shared, and deployed to any cluster.

## Why Use Stacks?

  <Card title="Consistency Across Environments" icon="server">
    Deploy the same stack to dev, staging, and production to ensure every environment is configured identically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accelerate Onboarding" icon="user-plus">
    New clusters or teams can be up and running in minutes by applying a pre-built stack.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Simplify Updates" icon="gear">
    Update a stack and roll out changes to all clusters using it, reducing manual work and configuration drift.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Stack">
    Combine add-ons, profiles, and manifests in the Ankra platform to define your stack.
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the <b>Stacks</b> section.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Create Stack</b> and provide a name and description.</li>
      <li>Add the required add-ons, profiles, and manifests to your stack.</li>
      <li>Organize the order of resources as needed for dependencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Version and Share">
    Save and version your stack for easy reuse. Share stacks with your team or organization.
    <ul>
      <li>Assign a version to your stack for tracking changes.</li>
      <li>Share the stack with other users or teams in your organization.</li>
      <li>Maintain a history of changes for auditing and rollback.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy to Clusters">
    Apply a stack to one or many clusters to instantly provision all included resources and configurations.
    <ul>
      <li>Select the target clusters for deployment.</li>
      <li>Deploy the stack and monitor the rollout status.</li>
      <li>Verify that all add-ons, manifests, and profiles are applied as expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Stack Composition

- **Add-ons:** Monitoring, Ingress, Logging
- **Profiles:** Pre-configured Helm values for each add-on
- **Manifests:** Namespaces, RBAC, CRDs

Stacks make it easy to manage, scale, and standardize your Kubernetes infrastructure—no matter how complex your needs.
