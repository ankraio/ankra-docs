description: How to use GitOps YAML files with Ankra for cluster automation and configuration.
---

<Note>
Ankra makes it easy to manage clusters using GitOps. You can define your cluster's configuration, manifests, and add-ons in YAML, store them in Git, and let Ankra handle the automation.

## Single vs. Multiple YAML Approaches

Ankra supports two ways to organize your GitOps files:

- **Single YAML:** Everything is in one file. Best for simple or portable setups. [See the single YAML guide.](./cluster-gitops-single)
- **Multiple YAML (Include Paths):** Split your configuration, manifests, and add-ons into separate files or folders, and reference them using `include` paths. This page covers the multiple YAML approach, which is ideal for larger, modular, or team-based projects.


## Multiple YAML GitOps: Organize with Include Paths

For complex projects, you don't have to cram everything into a single YAML file. Ankra lets you split your cluster configuration, manifests, and add-ons into multiple files or folders. Just reference them using `include` paths in your main YAML. This keeps your setup modular, maintainable, and easy to scale.

## Example: Using Include Paths

Suppose your Git repository has this structure:

```
my-repo/
  manifests/
    namespace.yaml
    rbac.yaml
  addons/
    ingress.yaml
    monitoring.yaml
  import-cluster.yaml
```


Your `import-cluster.yaml` might look like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImportCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  git_repository:
    provider: github
    credential_name: my-credential
    branch: main
    repository: my-org/my-repo
  stacks:
  - name: platform-stack
    manifests:
    - include: manifests/
    addons:
    - include: addons/
```


Ankra will automatically load and apply all YAML files from the `manifests/` and `addons/` folders. You can also include individual files if you want more control.

---


## Best Practices

- **Keep related resources together.** Group manifests and add-ons by environment, team, or feature.
- **Use clear folder names.** Make it obvious what each folder contains (e.g., `manifests/`, `addons/`, `prod/`, `dev/`).
- **Automate with CI/CD.** Trigger Ankra syncs on pull requests or merges to main.
- **Review changes in Git.** Use pull requests to review and approve updates to your cluster configuration.

---


## How Ankra Syncs Your Cluster

1. You update or add YAML files in your Git repository.
2. Ankra detects the change and automatically syncs your cluster to match the new state.
3. All included manifests and add-ons are applied in the order you specify.

## Summary & Troubleshooting

- Use the multiple YAML approach for any project with more than a handful of resources, or when working with a team.
- Organize your repo for clarity and scalability—folders and clear names help a lot.
- If Ankra isn’t syncing as expected, double-check your Git credentials, branch names, and file paths. Make sure your YAML is valid and all referenced files exist in the repo.

> **Tip:** Use include paths for any project with more than a handful of resources. It keeps your setup clean and makes collaboration much easier.
