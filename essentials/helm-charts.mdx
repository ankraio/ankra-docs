description: Browse, manage, and deploy Helm charts from the Ankra chart browser
---

<Note>
The Helm Charts browser gives you a unified view of all available charts from your connected repositories, making it easy to discover and deploy applications to your clusters.
</Note>

## What is the Charts Browser?

The Charts page in Ankra provides:

- **Unified Catalog:** Browse charts from all connected Helm repositories in one place
- **Search & Filter:** Find charts by name, category, or repository
- **Version Management:** View available versions and changelogs
- **One-Click Deploy:** Add charts to stacks and deploy to clusters instantly

---

## Accessing Charts

Navigate to **Charts** in the main sidebar to open the chart browser. From here you can:

1. Browse all available charts
2. Search for specific applications
3. View chart details and documentation
4. Add charts to your cluster stacks

---

## Chart Repositories

Ankra connects to Helm chart repositories to index available charts. You can add:

- **Public Repositories:** Prometheus Community, Grafana, Jetstack, etc.
- **Private Repositories:** Your organization's internal chart repositories
- **OCI Registries:** Charts stored in OCI-compliant container registries

### Managing Repositories

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Chart Repositories">
    Go to **Charts → Repositories** or use the Command Palette (`⌘+K` → "Chart Repositories").
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a Repository">
    Click **Add Repository** and enter:
    - **Name:** A friendly name for the repository
    - **URL:** The Helm repository URL or OCI registry URL
    - **Authentication:** Credentials if required (username/password or token)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sync Charts">
    Ankra automatically indexes charts from the repository. Check the **Last Synced** timestamp to see when charts were last updated.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Browse Charts">
    Once synced, charts appear in the main Charts browser, tagged with their source repository.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Tip>
**Pin Versions:** When adding charts to production stacks, pin to specific versions to ensure reproducibility.

**Review Values:** Always review the default values and customize for your environment before deploying.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Use Private Repos:** Host your organization's charts in a private repository for better security and customization.
