# Profiles

<Note>
Profiles let you capture and reuse add-on configurations, making it easy to apply consistent settings across multiple clusters and environments.
</Note>

## What is a Profile?

A **Profile** in Ankra is a saved configuration for an add-on, including values, secrets, and overrides. Profiles enable you to quickly replicate and manage add-on setups across your clusters.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Save a Profile">
    Configure an add-on as needed, then save the configuration as a profile in the Ankra platform.
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the <b>Add-ons</b> section and select your desired add-on.</li>
      <li>Customize values, secrets, and overrides as required for your environment.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Save as Profile</b> to store this configuration for future use.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Profile to Clusters">
    Use the saved profile to deploy the same configuration to one or many clusters.
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <b>Profiles</b> section in Ankra.</li>
      <li>Select the profile you want to use.</li>
      <li>Choose the target clusters and apply the profile to instantly replicate your setup.</li>
      <li>Profiles can be used during cluster creation or applied to existing clusters at any time.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update and Roll Out Changes">
    Edit a profile and push updates to all clusters using it, ensuring every environment stays in sync.
    <ul>
      <li>Modify the profile’s configuration as your requirements evolve.</li>
      <li>Save changes and roll out updates to all clusters linked to this profile.</li>
      <li>Monitor rollout status and verify consistency across environments.</li>
      <li>Rollback to previous versions if needed for safety and compliance.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Profile Use Cases

- **Dev, Staging, Prod Consistency:**
  Use profiles to ensure each environment uses the same add-on configuration, reducing drift and troubleshooting time.
- **Security & Compliance:**
  Enforce organization-wide security settings by saving them as a profile and applying them everywhere.
- **Rapid Onboarding:**
  New clusters or teams can be set up quickly by applying existing profiles.

Profiles are ideal for organizations managing multiple environments (dev, staging, prod) or teams that want to enforce best practices and streamline operations.
