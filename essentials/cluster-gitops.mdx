description: How to use GitOps YAML files with Ankra for cluster automation and configuration.
---

<Note>
Ankra supports GitOps workflows for cluster management. You can define your cluster's configuration, manifests, and add-ons in a YAML file and automate deployments from a Git repository.

## What is a GitOps File?

A GitOps file is a YAML definition that tells Ankra how to configure and manage your cluster using resources stored in a Git repository. This approach lets you automate cluster setup, keep everything versioned, and use Git as the source of truth for your infrastructure.

## Supported GitOps File Types

There are two ways to structure your GitOps file in Ankra:

### 1. Single YAML Definition
- All configuration, manifests, and add-ons are defined in a single YAML file.
- Manifests and add-ons are included directly in the file, often as base64-encoded content.
- This is best for simple or self-contained setups.

### 2. Multiple YAML Definition (Include Paths)
- The main YAML file references other files or directories for manifests and add-ons using include paths.
- This is useful for larger projects where you want to organize resources in separate files or folders.
- Manifests and add-ons can be stored in the repository and included as needed.

## Example: Single YAML Definition

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImportCluster
metadata:
  name: k0s-rasPi
  description: Your imported cluster
spec:
  git_repository:
    provider: github
    credential_name: User-CodeStaple
    branch: main
    repository: CodeStaple/addons2
  stacks:
  - name: infisical
    description: ''
    manifests:
    - name: infisical ns
      manifest_base64: <base64-encoded YAML>
      namespace: infisical
      parents: []
    - name: infisical secret
      manifest_base64: <base64-encoded YAML>
      namespace: infisical
      parents:
      - name: infisical ns
        kind: manifest
    addons:
    - name: infisical
      chart_name: infisical
      chart_version: 0.4.2
      repository_url: https://dl.cloudsmith.io/public/infisical/helm-charts/helm/charts
      namespace: infisical
      configuration_type: standalone
      configuration:
        values_base64: <base64-encoded values.yaml>
      parents:
      - name: infisical secret
        kind: manifest
```

## Example: Multiple YAML Definition (Include Paths)

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ImportCluster
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  git_repository:
    provider: github
    credential_name: my-credential
    branch: main
    repository: my-org/my-repo
  stacks:
  - name: my-stack
    manifests:
    - include: manifests/
    addons:
    - include: addons/
```

- In this example, `manifests/` and `addons/` are directories in your Git repository containing YAML files for manifests and add-ons.
- Ankra will load and apply all resources from these paths.

## How It Works

- Ankra watches your Git repository for changes.
- When you update your YAML files, Ankra automatically syncs your cluster to match the desired state.
- You can use either approach (single file or includes) depending on your project size and workflow.

> **Tip:** Use base64 encoding for manifest and values content in single YAML files to keep everything self-contained. For larger projects, organize your resources in folders and use include paths for better structure.
