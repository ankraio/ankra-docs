<Tip>
Adding your own registry to Ankra enables you and your team to distribbute helm-charts as add-on components that can be deployed onto a cluster as part of a stack.

## ðŸ”— How to add a registry to Ankra

<Note>
The contents of the registry you add is available to *your account only* by default. 
</Note>

1. Go to the **Add-ons** section in your Ankra Platform
2. Click **"Manage Sources"**
3. Add your registry URL, for example:
   - [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry): `oci://ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/helm-charts`
   - [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/docs/): `https://your-harbor.example.com/chartrepo/your-project`
   - [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/helm): `oci://LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY/helm-charts`
   - Other OCI registries: `oci://registry.example.com/helm-charts`

**Once added:** All Helm charts in your registry become available as add-ons in the UI or CLI, ready to be deployed as part of stacks and managed on your clusters.

With your own registry, custom Helm charts can be distributed to your team and integrated with Ankra's add-on management workflow engine.
