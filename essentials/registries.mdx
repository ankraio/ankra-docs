title: Manage Add-on Sources
description: Add-on sources let you connect external Helm repositories or OCI registries to Ankra, so you and your team can use custom or third-party Helm charts as add-ons in your clusters.

## What is an Add-on Source?

An add-on source is a connection to an external Helm repository or OCI (Open Container Initiative) registry. These sources contain Helm charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. By adding an add-on source to Ankra, you and your team can use both custom and third-party Helm charts as add-ons in your clusters. This makes it easy to standardize, share, and automate the deployment of applications and tools across your environments.

<Tip>
Adding your own add-on source to Ankra enables you and your team to distribute Helm charts as add-on components that can be deployed onto a cluster as part of a stack.

## ðŸ”— How to add an add-on source to Ankra

<Note>
The contents of the add-on source you add are available to *your account only* by default.
</Note>

1. Go to the **Add-ons** section in your Ankra Platform
2. Click **"Manage Sources"**
3. Add your add-on source URL, for example:
   - [GHCR](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry): `oci://ghcr.io/YOUR_USERNAME/helm-charts`
   - [Harbor](https://goharbor.io/docs/): `https://your-harbor.example.com/chartrepo/your-project`
   - [Google Artifact Registry](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/helm): `oci://LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/PROJECT_ID/REPOSITORY/helm-charts`
   - Other OCI registries: `oci://registry.example.com/helm-charts`

**Once added:** All Helm charts in your registry become available as add-ons in the UI or CLI, ready to be deployed as part of stacks and managed on your clusters.

With your own registry, custom Helm charts can be distributed to your team and integrated with Ankra's add-on management workflow engine.
