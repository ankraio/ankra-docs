## What Does "Import Cluster" Mean?

Currently, Ankra supports importing existing Kubernetes clusters into the platform. This means you can bring in a cluster from any provider or on-premises environment by installing the Ankra Agent. Once the agent is running, your cluster is connected to Ankra and you can use all platform features: deploy add-ons and stacks, monitor resources, automate operations, and get unified visibility and control.

The Ankra Agent is what unlocks the platformâ€™s full functionality. You can manage, observe, and automate your clusters from a single dashboard, no matter where they run.

## Start Importing Your Cluster
<Steps>
  <Step title="Import a Cluster">
    Start by importing an existing Kubernetes cluster into Ankra.
    <ul>
      <li>Go to <b>Clusters</b> in the Ankra platform.</li>
      <li>Click <b>Import Cluster</b> to add your existing cluster.</li>
      <li>Follow the instructions to install the Ankra Agent in your cluster.</li>
      <li>Once connected, your cluster will appear in the platform and be ready for management.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Add-ons, Manifests, and Stacks">
    Make your cluster more powerful by adding infrastructure components:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Add-ons:</b> Pick Helm charts and integrations for things like monitoring, ingress, or security.</li>
      <li><b>Manifests:</b> Add your own Kubernetes YAML files to set up namespaces, RBAC, CRDs, and more.</li>
      <li><b>Stacks:</b> Bundle your add-ons and manifests into a stack for quick, repeatable deployments.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Your Application">
    When your cluster stack is ready, deploy your apps and services.
    <ul>
      <li>Use <code>kubectl</code>, CI/CD pipelines, or the Ankra UI to launch your workloads.</li>
      <li>Watch deployment status and logs right in the platform.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Your Infrastructure Stack and UIs">
    After deployment, use the dashboards and UIs from your add-ons (like monitoring, logging, or ingress controllers) right from the Ankra platform.
    <ul>
      <li>Check health, manage resources, and work with your infrastructure in one place.</li>
      <li>Open add-on UIs quickly from the cluster overview page.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>
