# Creating a Cluster Stack

<Note>
Build a production-ready Kubernetes environment by combining clusters, add-ons, profiles, manifests, and stacks in Ankra.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Import a Cluster">
    Start by creating a new Kubernetes cluster in Ankra or importing an existing one from your cloud provider.
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to <b>Clusters</b> in the Ankra platform.</li>
      <li>Choose <b>Create Cluster</b> to provision a new cluster (AWS, GCP, Azure supported), or <b>Import Cluster</b> to bring in an existing environment.</li>
      <li>Configure settings such as region, size, and Kubernetes version as needed.</li>
      <li>Provision or import your cluster.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Add-ons, Profiles, Manifests, and Stacks">
    Enhance your cluster by selecting and configuring infrastructure components:
    <ul>
      <li><b>Add-ons:</b> Browse and subscribe to Helm charts and integrations (monitoring, ingress, security, etc.).</li>
      <li><b>Profiles:</b> Apply pre-configured settings for your add-ons to ensure consistency across environments.</li>
      <li><b>Manifests:</b> Add custom Kubernetes YAML files to automate the creation of namespaces, RBAC, CRDs, and more.</li>
      <li><b>Stacks:</b> Bundle your add-ons, profiles, and manifests into a reusable stack for rapid, repeatable deployments.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Your Application">
    Once your cluster stack is ready, deploy your workloads and applications.
    <ul>
      <li>Use <code>kubectl</code>, CI/CD pipelines, or the Ankra platform UI to launch your services.</li>
      <li>Monitor deployment status and logs directly from the platform.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Access Your Infrastructure Stack and UIs">
    After deployment, access the dashboards and UIs provided by your add-ons (such as monitoring, logging, or ingress controllers) directly from the Ankra platform.
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor health, manage resources, and interact with your infrastructureâ€”all in one place.</li>
      <li>Quickly access add-on UIs from the cluster overview page.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
