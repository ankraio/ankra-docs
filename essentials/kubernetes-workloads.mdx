title: Kubernetes Workloads
description: Manage Deployments, Pods, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, and CronJobs in Ankra
---

<Note>
The Workloads section in Ankra gives you complete visibility and control over all running applications in your Kubernetes clusters.
</Note>

## Overview

Workloads are the applications running in your cluster. Ankra provides a unified interface to view, manage, and troubleshoot all workload types:

- **Deployments** - Stateless applications with declarative updates
- **Pods** - The smallest deployable units
- **StatefulSets** - Stateful applications with stable identities
- **DaemonSets** - Pods that run on every node
- **ReplicaSets** - Maintain replica pod counts
- **Jobs** - Run-to-completion tasks
- **CronJobs** - Scheduled jobs
- **Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs)** - Automatic scaling

---

## Accessing Workloads

Navigate to your cluster and click **Kubernetes** in the sidebar. The Workloads section includes:

| Resource | Path |
|----------|------|
| Deployments | Kubernetes → Deployments |
| Pods | Kubernetes → Pods |
| StatefulSets | Kubernetes → StatefulSets |
| DaemonSets | Kubernetes → DaemonSets |
| ReplicaSets | Kubernetes → ReplicaSets |
| Jobs | Kubernetes → Jobs |
| CronJobs | Kubernetes → CronJobs |
| HPAs | Kubernetes → Horizontal Pod Autoscalers |

Or use the Command Palette (`⌘+K`) to jump directly to any resource type.

---

## Deployments

Deployments manage ReplicaSets and provide declarative updates for Pods.

### Viewing Deployments

The Deployments list shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Deployment name |
| Namespace | Kubernetes namespace |
| Ready | Ready replicas / Desired replicas |
| Up-to-date | Pods running the latest spec |
| Available | Pods available for traffic |
| Age | Time since creation |

### Deployment Details

Click a deployment to view:

- **Status** - Current rollout state and conditions
- **Replicas** - Desired, current, ready, and available counts
- **Strategy** - Rolling update or recreate
- **Pod Template** - Container specs, resources, environment
- **Events** - Recent Kubernetes events
- **Managed Pods** - List of pods owned by this deployment

### Actions

- **Scale** - Adjust replica count
- **Restart** - Trigger a rolling restart
- **View YAML** - See the full resource definition
- **Troubleshoot** - AI-assisted diagnosis
- **Delete** - Remove the deployment

---

## Pods

Pods are groups of containers that share storage and network.

### Viewing Pods

The Pods list shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | Pod name |
| Namespace | Kubernetes namespace |
| Ready | Ready containers / Total containers |
| Status | Running, Pending, Failed, etc. |
| Restarts | Container restart count |
| Age | Time since creation |
| Node | Node the pod is scheduled on |

### Pod Details

Click a pod to view:

- **Containers** - List of containers with status, image, and resources
- **Conditions** - PodScheduled, ContainersReady, Ready
- **Events** - Recent events (scheduling, pulling, started, etc.)
- **Labels & Annotations** - Metadata
- **Volumes** - Mounted volumes and claims

### Pod Logs

View real-time and historical logs:

1. Click on a pod
2. Select the **Logs** tab
3. Choose the container (for multi-container pods)
4. Toggle **Follow** for real-time streaming
5. Search within logs using the filter

### Actions

- **View Logs** - Stream container logs
- **View YAML** - Full pod specification
- **Troubleshoot** - AI analysis of pod issues
- **Delete** - Remove the pod (will be recreated by controllers)

---

## StatefulSets

StatefulSets manage pods with persistent identities and stable storage.

### Key Features

- **Stable Pod Names** - Pods have predictable names (app-0, app-1, etc.)
- **Persistent Storage** - Volume claims are retained across restarts
- **Ordered Operations** - Pods are created/deleted in order

### Viewing StatefulSets

The list shows replica status, update status, and age. Details include:

- Pod management policy
- Update strategy
- Volume claim templates
- Managed pods

---

## DaemonSets

DaemonSets ensure a pod runs on every (or selected) node.

### Use Cases

- Log collectors (Fluentd, Filebeat)
- Node monitoring (Prometheus node exporter)
- Network plugins (CNI, kube-proxy)
- Storage plugins (CSI drivers)

### Viewing DaemonSets

The list shows:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Desired | Pods that should be scheduled |
| Current | Currently running pods |
| Ready | Pods ready to serve |
| Up-to-date | Pods with latest spec |
| Available | Pods available |

---

## Jobs & CronJobs

### Jobs

Jobs create pods that run to completion:

- **Completions** - How many successful completions are needed
- **Parallelism** - How many pods can run concurrently
- **Status** - Active, succeeded, failed counts

### CronJobs

CronJobs schedule Jobs on a time-based schedule:

- **Schedule** - Cron expression (e.g., `0 */6 * * *`)
- **Last Schedule** - When it last ran
- **Active** - Currently running jobs
- **Suspend** - Whether scheduling is paused

---

## Horizontal Pod Autoscalers

HPAs automatically scale workloads based on metrics.

### Viewing HPAs

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Name | HPA name |
| Reference | Target deployment/statefulset |
| Min/Max | Replica bounds |
| Replicas | Current replica count |
| Metrics | CPU/Memory utilization |

### HPA Details

- Target metrics and current values
- Scaling history
- Conditions and events

---

## Common Tasks

### Troubleshooting a Failing Pod

1. Navigate to **Pods** and find the failing pod
2. Check the **Status** column for error indicators
3. Click the pod and review:
   - **Events** for scheduling or pull errors
   - **Logs** for application errors
   - **Conditions** for readiness issues
4. Click **Troubleshoot** for AI-assisted diagnosis

### Scaling a Deployment

1. Navigate to **Deployments**
2. Click on the deployment to scale
3. Click **Scale** and enter the new replica count
4. Confirm the change

### Restarting Pods

1. Navigate to **Deployments**
2. Click on the deployment
3. Click **Restart** to trigger a rolling restart
4. Monitor the rollout in **Events**

## Tips

<Tip>
**Use Namespace Filters:** Filter by namespace to focus on specific applications or environments.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Watch Events:** Kubernetes events often explain why pods are failing to start.
</Tip>

<Tip>
**Check Resource Limits:** Many pod failures are due to insufficient CPU or memory limits.
