# Cluster States

<Note>
Understanding the lifecycle states of your Ankra Kubernetes clusters helps you monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your infrastructure with confidence.

Ankra clusters transition through several operational states. Each state reflects the current readiness and accessibility of your cluster, from initial provisioning to full production readiness.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Stopped" icon="circle">
    <b>Configuration preserved, resources stopped.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>All cluster settings and resources are saved, but nothing is running.</li>
      <li>Minimizes cloud costs while retaining your setup for future use.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provider without Access" icon="cloud-slash">
    <b>Resources exist, but no access.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure is provisioned in your cloud provider.</li>
      <li>Access is blocked—often due to networking or IAM issues.</li>
      <li>Check VPC, firewall, or permissions if you see this state.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provider Access" icon="terminal">
    <b>Bastion host accessible, Kubernetes not yet ready.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>SSH into the bastion host is possible.</li>
      <li>Kubernetes API and workloads are not yet available.</li>
      <li>Useful for debugging early provisioning steps.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Kubernetes Access" icon="cube">
    <b>Kubernetes API available, networking may be limited.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Control plane is up and responding to <code>kubectl</code> commands.</li>
      <li>Some networking or add-ons may still be initializing.</li>
      <li>Monitor until full networking is established.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Running" icon="signal">
    <b>Cluster fully operational.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Container Network Interface (CNI) and all core services are running.</li>
      <li>Ready for deploying and scaling workloads.</li>
      <li>This is the normal production state.</li>

## How to Use Cluster States

- <b>Track Progress:</b> Follow your cluster as it moves through each state during provisioning or scaling.
- <b>Diagnose Issues:</b> Quickly identify where a problem occurs—networking, access, or Kubernetes itself.
- <b>Optimize Costs:</b> Use the <b>Stopped</b> state to pause clusters and save on cloud spend without losing configuration.

<Callout type="info">
You can view the current state of any cluster directly in the Ankra dashboard. For more details, check the <b>Cluster Details</b> page or use the API for programmatic monitoring.
