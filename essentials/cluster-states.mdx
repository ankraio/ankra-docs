## What Are Cluster States?

Cluster states in Ankra indicate whether the Ankra Agent running in your Kubernetes cluster is currently connected to the Ankra platform. This provides a simple, reliable signal of your cluster's availability for management and monitoring.

Currently, Ankra supports two cluster states:

- **Online:** The Ankra Agent in your cluster is connected to the Ankra platform. This means your cluster is reachable, healthy, and ready for management operations.
- **Offline:** The Ankra Agent is not connected to the Ankra platform. This usually means your cluster is unreachable—possibly due to network issues, cluster shutdown, or maintenance.

### Why Do Cluster States Matter?

- **Visibility:** Instantly see if your clusters are connected and available for management.
- **Platform Access:** When a cluster is offline, you cannot deploy stacks or gain insights from your cluster through the Ankra platform. Ensuring your cluster is online is essential for full platform functionality.

By focusing on these two clear states, Ankra makes it easy to monitor your infrastructure, respond quickly to connectivity issues, and ensure you can always manage and observe your clusters as needed.

<Note>
Cluster states help you monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your Ankra Kubernetes infrastructure with confidence.

Ankra clusters transition through several operational states. Each state reflects the current readiness and accessibility of your cluster, from initial provisioning to full production readiness.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Stopped" icon="circle">
    <b>Configuration preserved, resources stopped.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>All cluster settings and resources are saved, but nothing is running.</li>
      <li>Minimizes cloud costs while retaining your setup for future use.</li>
    </ul>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Provider without Access" icon="cloud-slash">
    <b>Resources exist, but no access.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>Infrastructure is provisioned in your cloud provider.</li>
      <li>Access is blocked—often due to networking or IAM issues.</li>
      <li>Check VPC, firewall, or permissions if you see this state.</li>
    </ul>

  <Card title="Provider Access" icon="terminal">
    <b>Bastion host accessible, Kubernetes not yet ready.</b>
    <ul>
      <li>SSH into the bastion host is possible.</li>

## How to Use Cluster States

- <b>Track Progress:</b> Follow your cluster as it moves through each state during provisioning or scaling.
- <b>Diagnose Issues:</b> Quickly identify where a problem occurs—networking, access, or Kubernetes itself.
- <b>Optimize Costs:</b> Use the <b>Stopped</b> state to pause clusters and save on cloud spend without losing configuration.

You can view the current state of any cluster directly in the Ankra dashboard. For more details, check the <b>Cluster Details</b> page or use the API for programmatic monitoring.
