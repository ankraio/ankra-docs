# Manifests

<Note>
Manifests are the foundation for customizing your Kubernetes clusters in Ankra. They allow you to define, automate, and standardize resources and configurations across all your environments.
</Note>

## What is a Manifest?

A **manifest** is a YAML file that describes Kubernetes resources—such as namespaces, ConfigMaps, CRDs, RBAC rules, deployments, and more. Manifests are declarative, meaning you specify the desired state and Kubernetes ensures your cluster matches it.

## Why Use Manifests in Ankra?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automate Cluster Setup" icon="bolt">
    Automatically create all required resources (namespaces, roles, CRDs, etc.) as part of your cluster provisioning or stack deployment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ensure Consistency" icon="check">
    Apply the same manifest to multiple clusters to guarantee every environment is configured identically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prepare for Add-ons" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Use manifests to set up prerequisites for add-ons (like CRDs or service accounts) so add-on installation is seamless.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version Control" icon="box">
    Store manifests in your repository to track changes, enable rollbacks, and support GitOps workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Upload a Manifest">
    Write your manifest YAML or upload an existing file in the Ankra platform.
    <ul>
      <li>Navigate to the <b>Manifests</b> section.</li>
      <li>Create a new manifest or upload your YAML file.</li>
      <li>Review and validate your configuration before saving.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Manifests in Stacks">
    Add manifests to a stack to automate the setup of foundational resources alongside your add-ons.
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <b>Stacks</b> section and select or create a stack.</li>
      <li>Add your manifests to the stack along with add-ons and profiles.</li>
      <li>Organize the order of resources as needed for dependencies.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Manifests to Clusters">
    Deploy manifests directly to one or many clusters, either manually or as part of a stack rollout.
    <ul>
      <li>Select the target clusters for deployment.</li>
      <li>Apply the manifest and monitor the rollout status.</li>
      <li>Verify resources are created and configured as expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: monitoring
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: monitoring
  name: monitoring-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "services"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```
