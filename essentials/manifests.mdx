description: Use Kubernetes manifests to customize and automate your cluster setup in Ankra.
---
<Note>
Manifests are the foundation for customizing your Kubernetes clusters in Ankra. They allow you to define, automate, and standardize resources and configurations across all your environments.
</Note>

## What is a Manifest?

A **manifest** is a YAML file that describes Kubernetes resources such as namespaces, ConfigMaps, CRDs, RBAC rules, deployments, and more. Manifests are declarative: you specify the desired state, and Kubernetes makes sure your cluster matches it.

## Why Use Manifests in Ankra?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Automate Cluster Setup" icon="bolt">
    Automatically create all the resources you need (namespaces, roles, CRDs, and more) as part of cluster setup or stack deployment.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ensure Consistency" icon="check">
    Use the same manifest on multiple clusters to make sure every environment is set up the same way.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Prepare for Add-ons" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Use manifests to set up things like CRDs or service accounts before installing add-ons, so everything works smoothly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version Control" icon="box">
    Keep manifests in your repository to track changes, roll back if needed, and support GitOps workflows.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create or Upload a Manifest">
    Write your manifest YAML or upload a file in the Ankra platform.
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <b>Manifests</b> section.</li>
      <li>Create a new manifest or upload your YAML file.</li>
      <li>Review and check your configuration before saving.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Include Manifests in Stacks">
    Add manifests to a stack to automate setting up key resources along with your add-ons.
    <ul>
      <li>Go to the <b>Stacks</b> section and select or create a stack.</li>
      <li>Add your manifests to the stack with your add-ons.</li>
      <li>Arrange the order of resources if some depend on others.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Manifests to Clusters">
    Deploy manifests to one or more clusters, either by themselves or as part of a stack rollout.
    <ul>
      <li>Pick the clusters you want to deploy to.</li>
      <li>Apply the manifest and watch the rollout status.</li>
      <li>Check that resources are created and set up as expected.</li>
    </ul>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Manifest

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: monitoring
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: monitoring
  name: monitoring-reader
rules:
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods", "services"]
    verbs: ["get", "list"]
```
