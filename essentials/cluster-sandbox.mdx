## What Is a Sandbox Cluster?

A sandbox cluster is a read-only demo environment that lets you explore Ankra's features without connecting a real Kubernetes cluster. It comes pre-populated with realistic Kubernetes resources, stacks, and synthetic metrics so you can see exactly how the platform works before importing your own infrastructure.

<Note>
Each organisation can have one sandbox cluster. It is always online, requires no agent installation, and is completely read-only.

## Key Characteristics

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Read-Only" icon="lock">
    All write operations are disabled. You can browse resources, view metrics, and explore stacks, but you cannot apply, patch, or delete anything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Agent Required" icon="plug">
    Unlike imported clusters, sandbox clusters don't need the Ankra Agent. There's nothing to install — everything runs inside the platform.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Always Online" icon="signal">
    Sandbox clusters are always shown as online. There are no connectivity issues since there is no real cluster behind them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pre-Populated Resources" icon="cubes">
    Comes with demo nodes, workloads, services, storage, config, and events so you can explore the full Kubernetes resource experience.

## Creating a Sandbox Cluster

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Clusters">
    Go to the <b>Clusters</b> section from the main dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Sandbox">
    Click <b>Create Sandbox</b> to spin up the demo cluster. The sandbox is created instantly — no waiting for an agent to connect.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Explore">
    Once created, the sandbox cluster appears in your cluster list as <b>sandbox-demo</b>. Click into it to start exploring Kubernetes resources, stacks, and metrics.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Creating a sandbox cluster also marks the "Create a cluster" step as complete in your getting started checklist.

## What's Included

When you create a sandbox cluster, it is seeded with a realistic set of Kubernetes resources and infrastructure stacks.

### Kubernetes Resources

| Resource Type               | Description                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Nodes**                   | 3 nodes — 1 control plane and 2 workers                 |
| **Namespaces**              | Multiple demo namespaces                                 |
| **Deployments**             | Sample application deployments                           |
| **StatefulSets**            | Stateful workloads (e.g. databases)                      |
| **DaemonSets**              | Cluster-wide daemons                                     |
| **ReplicaSets**             | Managed replica sets                                     |
| **Jobs & CronJobs**         | Batch and scheduled workloads                            |
| **Pods**                    | Pods in various states                                   |
| **Services**                | ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer services            |
| **Ingresses**               | Demo ingress resources                                   |
| **PersistentVolumes/Claims**| Storage resources                                        |
| **ConfigMaps & Secrets**    | Configuration and secret data                            |
| **Events**                  | Kubernetes cluster events                                |

### Infrastructure Stacks

The sandbox comes with two pre-configured stacks:

- **Monitoring Stack** — A demo monitoring stack with associated manifests, similar to what you'd deploy with Prometheus and Grafana.
- **Ingress Stack** — A demo ingress stack with manifests for ingress controller setup.

### Synthetic Metrics

The sandbox generates realistic metrics so you can explore the cluster metrics dashboard:

| Metric           | Simulated Range         |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| CPU usage        | 2.5 – 3.5 cores        |
| CPU capacity     | 8 cores                 |
| Memory usage     | 6,000 – 7,000 MiB      |
| Memory capacity  | 16,384 MiB              |
| Network receive  | 2 – 8 MB/s             |
| Network transmit | 1 – 5 MB/s             |
| Disk IOPS        | 50 – 200                |
| Pod restarts     | 2 – 5                   |

Metrics are randomly generated within these ranges on each request, giving a realistic feel when browsing the dashboard.

## What You Can Do

You can use the sandbox cluster to explore most of Ankra's read-only features:

- **Browse Kubernetes resources** — Navigate nodes, workloads, networking, storage, config, and events.
- **View cluster overview** — See the cluster dashboard with status, node info, and resource summary.
- **Explore stacks** — View the pre-deployed monitoring and ingress stacks and their manifests.
- **View metrics** — Check the cluster metrics dashboard with CPU, memory, network, and disk data.
- **Test the AI assistant** — Use the AI features to ask questions about the sandbox resources.

## What's Not Available

Since the sandbox is read-only, the following operations return a **sandbox mode** notice prompting you to import a real cluster:

| Operation                | Message                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Apply / Patch / Delete   | Write operations are not available in sandbox mode. Import a real cluster to make changes. |
| Terminal exec            | Terminal access is not available in sandbox mode. Import a real cluster to exec into pods. |
| Pod log streaming        | Log streaming is not available in sandbox mode.                                           |
| Git connect / disconnect | Git operations require a real cluster.                                                    |
| Agent token generation   | Sandbox clusters do not require an agent token.                                           |
| Stack deployment         | Stack deployment requires a real cluster.                                                 |
