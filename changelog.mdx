# AI Takes Center Stage

This month we've revamped our documentation to put the AI Assistant front and center, added comprehensive guides for building production stacks, and expanded integrations.

## Stack Builder

The visual Stack Builder is now a first-class citizen with comprehensive documentation.

**ReactFlow Canvas**: Drag-and-drop interface powered by ReactFlow for composing add-ons and manifests into deployable stacks.

**Visual Dependency Management**: Connect components on the canvas to define deployment order. Arrows show the flow - source deploys before target.

**Draft Stacks**: Work-in-progress configurations with auto-save, validation, and preview before publishing.

**Node Operations**: Click any component to edit values, view deployment status, or configure namespaces. Safe node deletion prevents dangling edges.

**Stack Cloning**: Clone any Stack to quickly create variations. Deploy the same Stack across dev, staging, and production with environment-specific tweaks.

**AI-Powered Composition**: Describe what you need and the AI builds the Stack directly in the canvas - not just recommendations.

**CLI Integration**: Manage Stacks from the terminal with the Ankra CLI:
- `ankra get stacks` - List all stacks in the active cluster
- `ankra get stacks <name>` - View stack details with manifests and addons
- `ankra clone <source> <dest>` - Clone stacks between clusters
- `ankra apply -f stack.yaml` - Apply stack configurations

Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automation.

## Insight Metrics

Real-time cluster metrics powered by Prometheus integration.

**Resource Usage Cards**: At-a-glance CPU and memory utilization across your cluster with current values and totals.

**Time Series Charts**: Interactive graphs for CPU by node, memory by node, disk I/O, and network traffic (RX/TX).

**Pod Restarts**: Bar chart showing restart counts by namespace to quickly identify unstable workloads.

**Configurable Time Ranges**: View metrics from 15 minutes to 7 days with automatic refresh intervals.

**Node-Level Drill-Down**: Click any series to isolate and focus on specific nodes.

## Helm Charts & Registries

Completely revamped Helm chart discovery and registry management.

**Chart Explorer**: Browse, search, and filter Helm charts from all connected registries. View chart metadata, versions, and dependencies.

**HTTP & OCI Registries**: Full support for both HTTP-based Helm repositories and OCI registries (GHCR, GAR, ECR, ACR, Docker Hub, Harbor).

**Auto-Sync**: Registries sync automatically to keep chart catalogs up to date. Configure sync intervals per registry.

**Credential Management**: Securely store and manage registry credentials with support for tokens, basic auth, and cloud provider authentication.

## Alerting

New alerting system to stay on top of cluster issues.

**Slack Webhooks**: Send alerts directly to Slack channels via incoming webhooks. Configure per-cluster or organization-wide.

**Alert Rules**: Define custom alert conditions based on cluster events, resource states, and thresholds.

**Event-Driven Notifications**: Get notified on deployments, failures, scaling events, and health changes.

## AI Assistant Enhancements

The AI Assistant is now the centerpiece of the Ankra experience.

**Page-Aware Context**: The AI automatically knows what you're looking at. Open a pod and it already has the logs, manifest, events, and related resources. No copy-pasting or explaining.

**Incident Triangulation**: Root cause analysis across multiple data sources:
- Container logs with error detection
- Prometheus metrics and anomalies
- Kubernetes manifests and configurations
- Stack deployment history and changes
- Resource relationships and dependencies

**Stack Building**: Describe infrastructure in natural language and the AI builds it:
- *"I need a monitoring stack with Prometheus and Grafana"*
- AI selects add-ons, configures values, sets dependencies
- Places nodes on canvas and connects the flow
- You review and deploy with one click

**Unified Context Layers**: The AI combines all context for comprehensive understanding:
| Layer | What AI Sees |
|-------|-------------|
| Logs | Container stdout/stderr, error patterns |
| Metrics | CPU, memory, network, custom metrics |
| Manifests | Current and desired state, diffs |
| Events | Kubernetes events, warnings, errors |
| History | Deployment timeline, who changed what |

**New Shortcut**: Press `⌘+J` (Mac) or `Ctrl+J` (Windows/Linux) from anywhere.

**Claude Opus 4.5**: The AI Assistant now runs on Claude Opus 4.5 - Anthropic's most capable model - by default. No configuration needed.

**Cloudflare Tunnel**: Expose services without public IPs or open firewall ports. [Read the guide](/guides/cloudflare-tunnel)

## New Integrations

**Helm Registries**: Expanded documentation for HTTP and OCI registries with provider-specific setup. [Learn more](/integrations/helm-registries)

## New Documentation

**Kubernetes Resources**: Complete pages for Workloads, Networking, Storage, Configuration, and RBAC.

**Command Palette Guide**: Full reference for `⌘+K` navigation, shortcuts, and commands. [Learn more](/essentials/command-palette)

## Documentation Improvements

**Restructured Navigation**: Reorganized into logical groups with AI Assistant prominently featured in Get Started.

**Consistent Formatting**: Standardized formatting across all pages.

# Supercharging Stack Builder & Workflows!

Safety, speed, visibility & brand-new integrations-everything you need to build, manage, and share infra.

## Stack Builder

**Safe Node Deletion**: Prevent new nodes linking to those being removed-no dangling edges or race conditions.

**Drag-and-Drop Layout**: Manually reposition nodes, then snap them back into a tidy grid with "Reorder."

**Reconcile Quick-Jump**: Click a resource's badge to dive directly into the underlying operation.

**Unsaved-Changes Prompt**: Real-time draft indicators highlight pending edits-and you'll be warned before leaving.

## Agent & Import Flow

**Upgrade Available**: Get notified when a new agent version is available-no more missing out on improvements.

**Pending-Upgrade Fix**: Agents no longer stall in "pending-upgrade"-rollbacks are a thing of the past.

# Enhanced import cluster flow with automated drafts, agent improvements, and expanded Kubernetes resource insights

## Upgraded Import Cluster Flow

**Cluster Drafts Saved Automatically**: Drafts persist in your browser session so you never lose your work if you navigate away. Resume drafts by clicking the island at the top center of any page.

**Real‑Time Stack Building**: When you have a draft, click the floating Add button in the top "island" panel to watch your full YAML manifest assemble live. Once you're done looking around the add‑ons and profiles, click the import icon to return to the draft and submit it for completion to get the command and import your cluster.

## Import Cluster Agent Enhancements

**Seamless Local‑to‑Cloud Parity**: Use the `helm install ankra-agent` command from the import cluster on your laptop or on your Kubernetes clusters.

**Expanded Resource Insights**: Live access to Kubernetes resources.

**ARM & macOS Native Support**: Prebuilt binaries for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) and generic ARM64 servers. Easy helm install from the import cluster: `helm install ankra-agent`.

## Roadmap Preview: Kubernetes‑Native Integrations

Upcoming support for streaming capabilities that will allow real‑time exploration of the Kubernetes environment:

- Expand ArgoCD integration to simplify troubleshooting
- Log streaming of pods
- Creation of Kubernetes resources with add‑ons

## Cluster Add‑on Management

**Add Multiple Add‑ons**: When you click add‑ons of an existing cluster, you can now add a stack of add‑ons in a single form. Just keep selecting add‑ons from the options.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements
