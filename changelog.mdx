# AI Goes Agentic, Full Observability & Secrets at Scale

The AI Assistant now operates in full agentic mode with 58 tools, alerting is built into every Ankra resource with AI-powered incident reports, and SOPS encryption integrates natively with ArgoCD.

## AI Agentic Mode

The AI Assistant is now a fully autonomous agent. It reads your cluster state, executes multi-step workflows, and proposes changes with a confirmation system.

**58 Tools**: 19 Kubernetes read tools (pods, logs, deployments, services, events, nodes, configmaps, secrets, and more), 7 Kubernetes write tools (restart, scale, delete, apply manifest, patch), 17 stack management tools (design, draft, deploy), and addon lifecycle tools (sync, rollback, history).

**Autonomous Workflows**: The agent chains up to 10 tool calls per response. Read operations execute immediately. Write operations require explicit confirmation with a Bill of Materials showing exactly what will change.

**Interactive Chat**: Tool activity indicators show what the agent is doing in real-time. Stack preview cards visualize proposed changes. Action confirmation dialogs let you review before executing.

## AI Incident Reports & Root Cause Analysis

When an alert triggers, Ankra automatically generates a detailed AI incident report with root cause analysis, recommended actions, and conversation starters to continue investigating in the AI chat.

**Automated Pipeline**: Alert fires → cluster data collected (pods, events, logs, jobs) → AI analyzes root cause → structured report generated with severity, affected resources, and actionable recommendations.

**Interactive Follow-Up**: Every incident report includes conversation starters. Click one to open the AI chat with full context already loaded. Ask follow-up questions, run diagnostics, or apply fixes directly from the chat.

**Notification Integration**: Incident reports are shared as part of alert notifications in Slack, Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, and Opsgenie. Your team gets the root cause analysis alongside the error - no context switching.

**Proactive Analysis**: AI continuously monitors cluster health and surfaces insights before they become incidents. Dashboard widgets and notification banners keep you informed.

## Alerting Built Into All Ankra Resources

Alerts now monitor every resource type in Ankra - clusters, stacks, addons, manifests, and GitHub repositories.

**Resource-Aware Rules**: Define alert conditions against any Ankra resource. Filter by resource type, namespace, or labels. Combine conditions with AND/OR logic.

**Lifecycle Management**: Cooldown periods prevent alert storms. Auto-resolve when conditions return to healthy. Acknowledge or snooze alerts without deleting rules.

**Multi-Cluster Support**: Apply alert rules across all clusters or target specific ones.

**Webhook Notifications**: Slack, Microsoft Teams, PagerDuty, Discord, Opsgenie, and generic webhooks with template rendering and rich formatting per platform.

[Configure Alerts →](/essentials/alerts)

## Log Explorer

Real-time log streaming from any workload with powerful filtering and multi-pod support.

**Multi-Pod Aggregation**: Stream logs from up to 20 pods simultaneously. Select specific containers across pods. Logs are merged with pod and container tags.

**Search & Filter**: Text search with regex toggle. Auto-detect log levels (Error, Warn, Info, Debug) and filter by level. Configurable tail lines (100, 500, 1000, 5000, all).

**Display Options**: Adjustable font size (10-20px), line wrapping, timestamps, fullscreen mode, and download capability. Play/pause controls for high-volume streams.

[Learn more →](/essentials/logs)

## Terminal to Any Pod

Open a terminal directly into any running pod container from the Ankra dashboard.

**Shell Selection**: Choose from `/bin/sh`, `/bin/bash`, `/bin/zsh`, or `/bin/ash`. Select the target container from a dropdown.

**Full Terminal**: Powered by xterm.js with auto-resize, dark theme, and connection status indicator. 30-minute idle timeout with automatic keepalive.

## Multi-Select Delete for Kubernetes Resources

Bulk select and delete Kubernetes resources across 20+ resource types.

**Checkbox Selection**: Select individual rows or use the header checkbox to select all visible resources. Bulk actions bar appears with selection count.

**Safe Deletion**: Confirmation dialog lists up to 10 resources before proceeding. Sequential deletion with progress tracking. Error details shown per failed item.

**Supported Resources**: Pods, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, ReplicaSets, Jobs, CronJobs, Services, Ingresses, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PersistentVolumes, PVCs, ServiceAccounts, Roles, ClusterRoles, NetworkPolicies, PDBs, CRDs, StorageClasses, and more.

## Stack Cloning

Clone any stack between clusters with automatic conflict resolution and encrypted value handling.

**Cross-Cluster Cloning**: Clone deployed stacks or drafts to any cluster you have access to. Cloned stacks are created as drafts for review before deploying.

**Smart Conflict Resolution**: Name conflicts are automatically resolved with suffixes. Parent relationships are preserved. SOPS-encrypted values are stripped for security with clear warnings.

**CLI Support**: `ankra cluster stacks clone <stack_name> --to <target_cluster>` with options for custom names and addon configuration inclusion.

[Clone Stacks Guide →](/guides/clone-stack)

## Metrics Revamp

Redesigned metrics visualization with new chart components and AI-powered insights.

## SOPS Integration with ArgoCD

End-to-end secret encryption using SOPS with AGE keys, fully integrated with ArgoCD for automatic decryption during GitOps sync.

**Selective Encryption**: Encrypt specific YAML keys (passwords, API tokens, connection strings) while keeping the rest of the file readable.

**AGE Key Management**: Generate AGE key pairs at the organisation level. Public key encrypts values. Private key stored securely in Vault.

**ArgoCD Decryption**: AGE private key automatically deployed to the ArgoCD namespace. Helm-secrets plugin and SOPS binary configured on the ArgoCD repo-server. Encrypted values are decrypted on-the-fly during Helm rendering.

**Key Rotation**: Re-encrypt content with new keys when rotating credentials.

[SOPS Guide →](/essentials/sops)

## Variables: Org, Cluster & Stack Levels

Define variables at three levels with automatic precedence resolution.

**Three-Tier Hierarchy**: Organisation variables apply to all clusters. Cluster variables override organisation values. Stack variables take highest precedence.

**Syntax**: Use `${{ ankra.variable_name }}` in manifests and Helm values files. Variables are resolved during stack deployment.

**Secret Variables**: Mark variables as secrets for masked display in the UI. Copy syntax buttons for quick insertion.

[Variables Guide →](/essentials/variables)
