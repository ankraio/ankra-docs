# Supercharging Stack Builder & Workflows!

Safety, speed, visibility & brand-new integrations-everything you need to build, manage, and share infra.

## Stack Builder

**Safe Node Deletion**: Prevent new nodes linking to those being removed-no dangling edges or race conditions.

**Drag-and-Drop Layout**: Manually reposition nodes, then snap them back into a tidy grid with "Reorder."

**Reconcile Quick-Jump**: Click a resource's badge to dive directly into the underlying operation.

**Unsaved-Changes Prompt**: Real-time draft indicators highlight pending edits-and you'll be warned before leaving.

## Agent & Import Flow

**Upgrade Available**: Get notified when a new agent version is available-no more missing out on improvements.

**Pending-Upgrade Fix**: Agents no longer stall in "pending-upgrade"-rollbacks are a thing of the past.

## AI & Automation

**In-Context AI Chat**: AI Assistant now lives on every page-get guidance right where you work. It's like having a personal DevOps expert at your fingertips.

**Chat History**: View past conversations in the AI Assistant sidebar-no more lost context.

**Anthropic Models**: Use some of the most advanced AI models available today. Choose between: Claude 3.5 Haiku, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4.

## Resource & CRD Management

**CRD Explorer**: Browse all CRDs in-app, with filters to zero in on exactly what you need.

**IaC Source View**: Click "View Source" on any generated resource to inspect the GitHub-hosted files.

## Search & Shareability

**Shareable URLs**: Bookmark or share any filtered list-teammates see exactly what you see.

**Enter-Key Power-Up**: Press Enter in ⌘+K to immediately run searches or actions.

## Integrations & Ecosystem

**Terraform Provider (Alpha)**: Define clusters, stacks, and add-ons as code-live on Terraform & OpenTofu. [Read Docs](https://docs.ankra.io/integrations/terraform)

**Monitoring Stack Walk-Through**: Step-by-step video guide with GitOps examples. [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__EQEh0GZAY&t=4s)

**GitOps Enhancements**: Bidirectional syncing & auto-cleanup of stale files. [Learn More](https://docs.ankra.io/essentials/cluster-gitops-single)

**Ankra CLI**: Scriptable imports, builds, and add-on management right in your terminal. [Get the CLI](https://docs.ankra.io/integrations/ankra-cli)

## Usability & Productivity

**Sidebar State Saver**: Hide or show the sidebar without losing your custom panel layout.

**Download & Copy**: One-click download or copy of cluster add-on configs for backups and sharing.

**Improved Error Messages**: Actionable hints (e.g. invalid URL format) instead of cryptic failures.

**OCI-Backed Add-on Sources**: Support for OCI Helm charts now live-private & credential-based OCI coming next month.

# Stack Builder, Supercharging Infrastructure!

The new Stack Builder update is packed with features to speed up your workflows and make infrastructure building easier than ever. Here's what's live:

## Stack Builder: Go from 0 to 100 in 2.3s

**Unified Stacks**: Build with manifests and add‑ons side by side. Apply your organization's custom configs and get add‑ons working out of the box.

**Cluster Manifest List & View**: Instantly browse and inspect all manifests in your cluster.

**Edge Management**: Delete and manage edges in your stack. Nodes now require at least one incoming edge for safety.

**Live Node Status**: See the status of each node directly from the builder review. Watch it go from planned to live from within the interactive builder.

**Cluster Stack Deletion**: Instantly remove entire stacks when you need to reset.

## Repository & GitOps Integration

**Repo Sync**: Keep your infrastructure and code always in sync.

**Create GitHub Repo**: Launch new repositories directly from Ankra, ready for GitOps.

**GitHub Credential Banner**: Get notified if your integration needs attention. Every cluster needs a GitHub repo for full GitOps integration and to build your first stack.

## AI & Automation

**AI Stack Builder**: Rapidly generate and connect infrastructure stacks using AI.

**AI Assistant**: When you select an add‑on or manifest, the assistant guides you through creating and understanding manifests.

## Team Collaboration

**Multi‑Org & Multi‑User**: Easily invite your team and collaborate across multiple organizations.

## Add‑on Experience

**Stack Add‑on Cards**: Visual add‑on cards for fast browsing.

**Add‑on Listing Toggle**: Switch between only subscribed add‑ons and all available for easier management.

## Usability & Productivity

**LocalStorage Drafts**: Your changes are auto‑saved as you work.

**Background Stack Refresh**: See instant, real‑time updates to your stacks.

**Parent Validation**: Prevents duplicate names and parent mismatches automatically.

**Live Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is now available across the platform.

# Enhanced import cluster flow with automated drafts, agent improvements, and expanded Kubernetes resource insights

## Upgraded Import Cluster Flow

**Cluster Drafts Saved Automatically**: Drafts persist in your browser session so you never lose your work if you navigate away. Resume drafts by clicking the island at the top center of any page.

**Real‑Time Stack Building**: When you have a draft, click the floating Add button in the top "island" panel to watch your full YAML manifest assemble live. Once you're done looking around the add‑ons and profiles, click the import icon to return to the draft and submit it for completion to get the command and import your cluster.

## Import Cluster Agent Enhancements

**Seamless Local‑to‑Cloud Parity**: Use the `helm install ankra-agent` command from the import cluster on your laptop or on your Kubernetes clusters.

**Expanded Resource Insights**: Live access to Kubernetes resources.

**ARM & macOS Native Support**: Prebuilt binaries for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) and generic ARM64 servers. Easy helm install from the import cluster: `helm install ankra-agent`.

## Roadmap Preview: Kubernetes‑Native Integrations

Upcoming support for streaming capabilities that will allow real‑time exploration of the Kubernetes environment:

- Expand ArgoCD integration to simplify troubleshooting
- Log streaming of pods
- Creation of Kubernetes resources with add‑ons

## Cluster Add‑on Management

**Add Multiple Add‑ons**: When you click add‑ons of an existing cluster, you can now add a stack of add‑ons in a single form. Just keep selecting add‑ons from the options.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

**General Fixes**: Resolved an issue where multi‑line strings were not being preserved.

**Quality of Life Improvements**: General improvements in the UI for a better user experience.
