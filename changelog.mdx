  #  Release: Stack Builder, Supercharging Infrastructure!

  The new Stack Builder update is packed with features to speed up your workflows and make infrastructure building easier than ever. Here's what's live:
  
  ## Stack Builder: Go from 0 to 100 in 2.3s
  
  **Unified Stacks**: Build with manifests and add-ons side by side. Apply your organization's custom configs and get add-ons working out of the box.
  
  **Cluster Manifest List & View**: Instantly browse and inspect all manifests in your cluster.
  
  **Edge Management**: Delete and manage edges in your stack. Nodes now require at least one incoming edge for safety.
  
  **Live Node Status**: See the status of each node directly from the builder review. Watch it go from planned to live from within the interactive builder.
  
  **Cluster Stack Deletion**: Instantly remove entire stacks when you need to reset.
  
  ## Repository & GitOps Integration
  
  **Repo Sync**: Keep your infrastructure and code always in sync.
  
  **Create GitHub Repo**: Launch new repositories directly from Ankra, ready for GitOps.
  
  **GitHub Credential Banner**: Get notified if your integration needs attention. Every cluster needs a GitHub repo for full GitOps integration and to build your first stack.
  
  ## AI & Automation
  
  **AI Stack Builder**: Rapidly generate and connect infrastructure stacks using AI.
  
  **AI Assistant**: When you select an add-on or manifest, the assistant guides you through creating and understanding manifests.
  
  ## Team Collaboration
  
  **Multi-Org & Multi-User**: Easily invite your team and collaborate across multiple organizations.
  
  ## Add-on Experience
  
  **Stack Add-on Cards**: Visual add-on cards for fast browsing.
  
  **Add-on Listing Toggle**: Switch between only subscribed add-ons and all available for easier management.
  
  ## Usability & Productivity
  
  **LocalStorage Drafts**: Your changes are auto-saved as you work.
  
  **Background Stack Refresh**: See instant, real-time updates to your stacks.
  
  **Parent Validation**: Prevents duplicate names and parent mismatches automatically.
  
  **Live Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is now available across the platform.

  # Enhanced import cluster flow with automated drafts, agent improvements, and expanded Kubernetes resource insights.
  
  ## Upgraded Import Cluster Flow
  
  **Cluster Drafts Saved Automatically**: Drafts persist in your browser session so you never lose your work if you navigate away. Resume drafts by clicking the island at the top center of any page.
  
  **Real-Time Stack Building**: When you have a draft, click the floating Add button in the top "island" panel to watch your full YAML manifest assemble live. Once you're done looking around the add-ons and profiles, click the import icon to return to the draft and submit it for completion to get the command and import your cluster.
  
  ## Import Cluster Agent Enhancements
  
  **Seamless Local-to-Cloud Parity**: Use the `helm install ankra-agent` command from the import cluster on your laptop or on your Kubernetes clusters.
  
  **Expanded Resource Insights**: Live access to Kubernetes resources.
  
  **ARM & macOS Native Support**: Prebuilt binaries for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) and generic ARM64 servers. Easy helm install from the import cluster: `helm install ankra-agent`.
  
  ## Roadmap Preview: Kubernetes-Native Integrations
  
  Upcoming support for streaming capabilities that will allow real-time exploration of the Kubernetes environment:
  
  - Expand ArgoCD integration to simplify troubleshooting
  - Log streaming of pods
  - Creation of Kubernetes resources with add-ons
  
  ## Cluster Add-on Management
  
  **Add Multiple Add-ons**: When you click add-ons of an existing cluster, you can now add a stack of add-ons in a single form. Just keep selecting add-ons from the options.
  
  ## Bug Fixes & Improvements
  
  **General Fixes**: Resolved an issue where multi-line strings were not being preserved.
  
  **Quality of Life Improvements**: General improvements in the UI for a better user experience.
