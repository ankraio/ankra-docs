Welcome to Ankra! Getting your Kubernetes environments connected is the first step to managing your entire stack from a single, unified platform. Whether you’re importing a cluster in the cloud or a local one, Ankra empowers you to deploy, observe, and control your infrastructure with ease. Let’s get started on your journey to streamlined, full-stack management.

            <b>Run the Helm agent command:</b> Ankra provides a Helm command tailored for your cluster. Run this in the terminal where you're connected to your Kubernetes cluster (including local setups like Minikube or Kind) to establish a secure connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Manage infrastructure via Stacks & Add-ons:</b> Once imported, you can maintain or expand your cluster's capabilities by deploying stacks of add-ons onto your cluster. [What is a stack?](/essentials/stacks)
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Values files stored safely:</b> If you disconnect from Ankra, your configuration (values files) is preserved in a Git repository of your choice, ensuring you retain full control and auditability.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Connect to GitHub">
        Store and version-control your infrastructure configuration securely.

          <li>
            <b>Navigate to <b>Cluster Settings</b>:</b> Access the Repository tab section at the top to connect external services. The repository selected will create a folder called cluster with your GitOps files.

          <li>
            <b>Select <b>Connect GitHub</b>:</b> Authorize Ankra to access your GitHub account. This enables automated storage of values files and configuration history.
