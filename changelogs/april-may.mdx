# April-May 2025 Release

## Upgraded Import Cluster Flow

**Cluster Drafts Saved Automatically**: Drafts persist in your browser session so you never lose your work if you navigate away. Resume drafts by clicking the island at the top center of any page.

**Real-Time Stack Building**: When you have a draft, click the floating Add button in the top "island" panel to watch your full YAML manifest assemble live. Once you're done looking around the add-ons and profiles, click the import icon to return to the draft and submit it for completion to get the command and import your cluster.

## Import Cluster Agent Enhancements

**Seamless Local-to-Cloud Parity**: Use the `helm install ankra-agent` command from the import cluster on your laptop or on your Kubernetes clusters.

**Expanded Resource Insights**: Live access to Kubernetes resources.

**ARM & macOS Native Support**: Prebuilt binaries for Apple Silicon (M1/M2) and generic ARM64 servers. Easy helm install from the import cluster: `helm install ankra-agent`.

## Roadmap Preview: Kubernetes-Native Integrations

Upcoming support for streaming capabilities that will allow real-time exploration of the Kubernetes environment:

- Expand ArgoCD integration to simplify troubleshooting
- Log streaming of pods
- Creation of Kubernetes resources with add-ons

## Cluster Add-on Management

**Add Multiple Add-ons**: When you click add-ons of an existing cluster, you can now add a stack of add-ons in a single form. Just keep selecting add-ons from the options.

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

**General Fixes**: Resolved an issue where multi-line strings were not being preserved.

**Quality of Life Improvements**: General improvements in the UI for a better user experience.
