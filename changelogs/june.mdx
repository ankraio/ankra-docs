# June-July Release: Stack Builder, Supercharging Infrastructure!

The new Stack Builder update is packed with features to speed up your workflows and make infrastructure building easier than ever. Here's what's live:

## Stack Builder: Go from 0 to 100 in 2.3s

**Unified Stacks**: Build with manifests and add-ons side by side. Apply your organization's custom configs and get add-ons working out of the box.

**Cluster Manifest List & View**: Instantly browse and inspect all manifests in your cluster.

**Edge Management**: Delete and manage edges in your stack. Nodes now require at least one incoming edge for safety.

**Live Node Status**: See the status of each node directly from the builder review. Watch it go from planned to live from within the interactive builder.

**Cluster Stack Deletion**: Instantly remove entire stacks when you need to reset.

## Repository & GitOps Integration

**Repo Sync**: Keep your infrastructure and code always in sync.

**Create GitHub Repo**: Launch new repositories directly from Ankra, ready for GitOps.

**GitHub Credential Banner**: Get notified if your integration needs attention. Every cluster needs a GitHub repo for full GitOps integration and to build your first stack.

## AI & Automation

**AI Stack Builder**: Rapidly generate and connect infrastructure stacks using AI.

**AI Assistant**: When you select an add-on or manifest, the assistant guides you through creating and understanding manifests.

## Team Collaboration

**Multi-Org & Multi-User**: Easily invite your team and collaborate across multiple organizations.

## Add-on Experience

**Stack Add-on Cards**: Visual add-on cards for fast browsing.

**Add-on Listing Toggle**: Switch between only subscribed add-ons and all available for easier management.

## Usability & Productivity

**LocalStorage Drafts**: Your changes are auto-saved as you work.

**Background Stack Refresh**: See instant, real-time updates to your stacks.

**Parent Validation**: Prevents duplicate names and parent mismatches automatically.

**Live Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation is now available across the platform.
