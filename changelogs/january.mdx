- Visual progress bars for resource distribution
- Quick access to create stacks directly from cluster cards
- GitOps connection status and agent update indicators

**Alerts Summary**: Real-time alert statistics with quick navigation to alert management:
- Alert counts by severity
- Recent alert activity
- Direct links to alert configuration

**Operations Activity**: Timeline of recent operations across all clusters:
- Deployment status and progress
- Operation names and timestamps
- Quick navigation to operation details

**GitOps Sync Status**: Repository connection overview:
- Connected vs disconnected cluster counts
- Per-cluster sync status
- Direct links to GitOps configuration

**AI Insights**: Summary of AI-powered analyses:
- Recent incident analyses
- Cluster health assessments
- Quick access to AI Assistant

**Stacks Overview**: Stack deployment statistics per cluster:
- Total stack counts
- Deployment status indicators
- Quick links to Stack Builder

**Helm Repositories**: Connected registry summary:
- Registry counts and types
