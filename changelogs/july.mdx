![Ankra Logo](https://sy7um.mjt.lu/img2/sy7um/4bb49a09-1fba-482a-b3f3-30f7a63a1386/content)

Safety, speed, visibility & brand-new integrations—everything you need to build, manage, and share infra.

## Stack Builder

- **Safe Node Deletion**: Prevent new nodes linking to those being removed—no dangling edges or race conditions.
- **Drag-and-Drop Layout**: Manually reposition nodes, then snap them back into a tidy grid with "Reorder."
- **Reconcile Quick-Jump**: Click a resource's badge to dive directly into the underlying operation.
- **Unsaved-Changes Prompt**: Real-time draft indicators highlight pending edits—and you'll be warned before leaving.

## Agent & Import Flow

- **Upgrade Available**: Get notified when a new agent version is available—no more missing out on improvements.

- **Pending-Upgrade Fix**: Agents no longer stall in "pending-upgrade"—rollbacks are a thing of the past.

## AI & Automation

- **In-Context AI Chat**: AI Assistant now lives on every page—get guidance right where you work. It's like having a personal DevOps expert at your fingertips.

## Resource & CRD Management

- **CRD Explorer**: Browse all CRDs in-app, with filters to zero in on exactly what you need.
- **IaC Source View**: Click "View Source" on any generated resource to inspect the GitHub-hosted files.

## Search & Shareability

- **Shareable URLs**: Bookmark or share any filtered list—teammates see exactly what you see.
- **Enter-Key Power-Up**: Press Enter in ⌘+K to immediately run searches or actions.

## Integrations & Ecosystem

- **Terraform Provider (Alpha)**: Define clusters, stacks, and add-ons as code—live on Terraform & OpenTofu. [Read Docs](https://docs.ankra.io/integrations/terraform)
- **Monitoring Stack Walk-Through**: Step-by-step video guide with GitOps examples. [Watch Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__EQEh0GZAY&t=4s)

- **Ankra CLI**: Scriptable imports, builds, and add-on management right in your terminal. [Get the CLI](https://docs.ankra.io/integrations/ankra-cli)

## Usability & Productivity

- **Sidebar State Saver**: Hide or show the sidebar without losing your custom panel layout.
- **Download & Copy**: One-click download or copy of cluster add-on configs for backups and sharing.
- **Improved Error Messages**: Actionable hints (e.g. invalid URL format) instead of cryptic failures.
