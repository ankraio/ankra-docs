# December 2025 Release: AI Takes Center Stage

This month we've completely revamped our documentation to put the AI Assistant front and center, added comprehensive guides for building production stacks, and expanded our integrations.

## Stack Builder

The visual Stack Builder is now a first-class citizen with comprehensive documentation.

**ReactFlow Canvas**: Drag-and-drop interface powered by ReactFlow for composing add-ons and manifests into deployable stacks. The canvas supports zooming, panning, and node selection.

**Visual Dependency Management**: Connect components on the canvas to define deployment order. Arrows show the flow - source deploys before target. Failed dependencies automatically stop downstream deployments.

**Draft Stacks**: Work-in-progress configurations with auto-save, real-time validation, and preview before publishing. Draft stacks appear with a badge in the stacks list.

**Node Operations**:
- Click any component to edit Helm values or manifest content
- View deployment status and reconciliation state
- Configure namespace and other metadata
- Safe deletion prevents dangling edges or race conditions

**Stack Cloning**: Quickly duplicate Stacks for reuse:
- Clone any Stack with one click from the menu
- Perfect for creating environment variations (dev/staging/prod)
- Cloned Stack gets a new name, all components and connections preserved
- Modify values per environment without rebuilding from scratch
- Share proven configurations across teams and clusters

**AI-Powered Composition**: Describe what you need and the AI builds the Stack directly in the canvas - placing nodes, connecting dependencies, and configuring values.

**Dependency Rules**:
- Components without dependencies deploy first (in parallel if possible)
- Connected components wait for their dependencies to complete
- Visual flow diagram shows deployment sequence

**CLI Integration**: Manage Stacks from the terminal with the Ankra CLI:
- `ankra get stacks` - List all stacks in the active cluster
- `ankra get stacks <name>` - View stack details with manifests and addons
- `ankra clone <source> <dest>` - Clone stacks between clusters
- `ankra clone ... --stacks monitoring,logging` - Clone specific stacks only
- `ankra apply -f stack.yaml` - Apply stack configurations from YAML
- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows

## Insight Metrics

Real-time cluster metrics powered by Prometheus integration.

**Resource Usage Cards**: At-a-glance CPU and memory utilization across your cluster with current values and totals displayed in compact cards.

**Time Series Charts**:
- CPU Usage by Node - cores used over time per node
- Memory Usage by Node - GiB consumed over time per node
- Disk I/O Operations - read/write ops per second
- Network Receive/Transmit - MiB/s traffic per node

**Pod Restarts Chart**: Bar chart showing restart counts by namespace to quickly identify unstable workloads.

**Configurable Time Ranges**: View metrics from 15 minutes to 7 days. Select from 15m, 1h, 3h, 6h, 12h, 24h, or 7d ranges.

**Auto-Refresh**: Metrics refresh automatically at configurable intervals.

**Node-Level Drill-Down**: Click any series in the legend to isolate and focus on specific nodes.

## Helm Charts & Registries

Completely revamped Helm chart discovery and registry management.

**Chart Explorer**:
- Browse all charts from connected registries in one place
- Search and filter by name, repository, or keywords
- View chart metadata, maintainers, and home links
- Explore all available versions with release notes
- See chart dependencies and requirements

**HTTP Registries**: Traditional Helm repositories with index.yaml:
- Add any public or private HTTP repository
- Automatic index sync and chart discovery
- Support for basic auth and token authentication

**OCI Registries**: Modern container registry support:
- GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
- Google Artifact Registry (GAR)
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Docker Hub
- Harbor
- Any OCI-compliant registry

**Auto-Sync**: Registries sync automatically to keep chart catalogs fresh. View last sync time and trigger manual sync when needed.

**Credential Management**: Securely store registry credentials:
- API tokens for private repositories
- Basic auth (username/password)
- Cloud provider service account keys
- Credentials stored securely in Vault

## Alerting

New alerting system to stay on top of cluster issues.

**Slack Webhooks**:
- Send alerts directly to Slack channels
- Configure incoming webhook URLs per cluster or organization
- Rich message formatting with cluster and resource context
- Step-by-step setup guide in docs

**Alert Rules**:
- Define custom alert conditions
- Filter by resource type, namespace, or labels
- Set severity levels for prioritization

**Event-Driven Notifications**:
- Deployment completions and failures
- Pod crashes and restarts
- Scaling events (HPA triggers)
- Health check failures
- Agent connectivity issues

## AI Assistant Enhancements

The AI Assistant is now the centerpiece of the Ankra experience - not just a helper, but your primary interface for understanding and managing clusters.

**Page-Aware Context**: The AI automatically knows what you're looking at. Open a pod and it already has:
- Container logs (stdout/stderr)
- Full YAML manifest
- Kubernetes events
- Related resources (ReplicaSet, Deployment, Service)
- Metrics if Prometheus is connected

No copy-pasting. No explaining. Just ask.

**Incident Triangulation**: When something breaks, the AI doesn't look at one thing - it looks at everything:
- **Logs**: Scans for error patterns, stack traces, OOMKilled signals
- **Metrics**: Checks CPU spikes, memory pressure, network anomalies
- **Manifests**: Compares current vs desired state, finds misconfigurations
- **Events**: Surfaces warnings, failed scheduling, image pull errors
- **History**: Shows what changed and when - deployment rollouts, config updates

Example: *"Why is my pod crashing?"* → AI finds the OOMKilled event, correlates with memory metrics showing spike, identifies the container without resource limits, and suggests the fix.

**Stack Building**: Describe infrastructure in natural language and watch the AI build it:
1. *"I need a monitoring stack with Prometheus, Grafana, and alerting"*
2. AI selects kube-prometheus-stack, configures retention, enables alertmanager
3. Places nodes on the Stack Builder canvas
4. Connects dependencies (namespace → prometheus → grafana)
5. You review the visual flow and deploy

Not recommendations - actual infrastructure, ready to deploy.

**Unified Context Layers**:
| Layer | What AI Sees |
|-------|-------------|
| Logs | Container stdout/stderr, error patterns, timestamps |
| Metrics | CPU, memory, network, disk, custom Prometheus metrics |
| Manifests | Current state, desired state, diffs, labels, annotations |
| Events | Kubernetes events, warnings, scheduling decisions |
| History | Deployment timeline, Stack changes, who changed what |

**New Shortcut**: Press `⌘+J` (Mac) or `Ctrl+J` (Windows/Linux) from anywhere in the app.

**Chat History**: Previous conversations persist in the sidebar. Pick up where you left off.

**Claude Opus 4.5**: The AI Assistant now runs on Claude Opus 4.5 by default - Anthropic's most intelligent and capable model. This upgrade brings improved reasoning, better code generation, and more accurate incident analysis out of the box.
